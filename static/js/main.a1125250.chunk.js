Photography is present in a wide range of practices from avant-garde arts to mass media, from the convention of photo identification to the techniques of surveillance, from photojournalism to selfies and Instagram. Photographs saturate all aspects of contemporary lives, demanding constant attention, interpretation, and consumption. This course offers an introductory survey of the diverse and pervasive field of photography from its origin in the early 19th century to the current digital moment. Students will learn to unpack photography as a multifaceted medium, namely, an artistic experience, a technological frontier, a mode of power, a cultural practice, and a sociohistorical text. Key photographers, movements, and important themes will be explored in tandem with the cultural contexts in which innovations and developments in photography unfolded. With special attention to the intersection of photography and Vietnamese history, the course will also demonstrate how constellations of power - with regards to class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economy, and geopolitics - influence the practice, dissemination, and preservation of photography in Vietnam today.\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course is designed to encourage students to: \\n\u2022 Acquire a solid foundation on key theoreticians and artists who have engaged with the medium of photography. \\n\u2022 Adopt an integrated range of flexible, research-led approaches to the studies of photographic history and theories. \\n\u2022 Strengthen key skills in writing, reading, and public engagement necessary for higher-level courses in the Art and Media Studies major as well as related fields.","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"09:30:00"}],"location":"Classroom 6 & 7"},{"title":"Dance and Performance Production","id":"ARTS106_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Alexander Tu Nguyen","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3NzQAJ/arts106spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Alexander Tu Nguyen - E: alexander.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite or Co-requisite: No\\nFormat: On-Campus\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course will introduce students to both the theoretical and practical fundamentals of dance, and the ways in which dance performances are produced.

This course is designed to help students understand basic narrative concepts and to develop storytelling strategies through a variety of moving image formats, including mainstream films and television, documentary films, video art, music videos, advertising, and propaganda. We will look at how narratives fuel various political agendas as well as the many strategies artists and filmmakers use to counter dominant narratives. We will deepen our understanding of these concepts, techniques, and problematics through in-class viewings and discussion of various moving image works, supported by theoretical readings focusing on the role of narrative in literature, film, and art.

A successful investment and fund management strategy, however, takes much more than what we see on Shark Tank. It requires crafting an investment thesis, gaining access to the best deal-flow, conducting due diligence, structuring transactions, and managing portfolio investments right up until exit. Along the way, investors need to navigate the often sensitive and complex interpersonal dynamics between themselves and their entrepreneurs, co-investors, and Limited Partners (LPs), just to name a few.\\n\\nAt the same time, ESG and impact investing is gaining momentum, with some of the world\'s leading fund managers incorporating social, environmental and governance factors into their investment decisions. What does it mean to pursue social and environmental outcomes when investing? Is there a trade-off between social impact and financial returns? We will begin to unpack some of these issues as well.\\n\\nThis course is aimed at students seeking to understand the \'nuts and bolts\' of early-stage investing and impact investing. It will be taught in a highly experiential manner by a current practitioner of early-stage investing in Vietnam. Students will learn the basic terminology, processes and strategies of early-stage investing and will apply them to practical case examples. Students will also hear from a number of guest speakers, including leading investors, entrepreneurs and other experts in the ecosystem, to gain a varied perspective.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the end of this course, students should be able to: \\nUnderstand the basic terminology, actors, processes and strategies of the venture capital industry across its different stages, from investment thesis formulation to due diligence to exit\\nApply this knowledge to real examples, considering the situation from both the investors\' as well as the entrepreneurs\' point of view\\nArticulate investment recommendations through clear and concise investment memorandums\\nExplain the rise of impact investing and ESG investing and its potential implications for the investment industry more broadly\\n---\\nDetailed Sessions Guide\\nSession 1: The entrepreneurial journey \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cThe Entrepreneurial Journey\u201d, Stuart Crainer, London Business School  \\n\u201cThe Questions Every Entrepreneur Must Answer\u201d, Amar Bidhe, Harvard Business Review, 1996 \\nSession 2: Structure of the VC industry: Who\u2019s who and how do VCs make money? \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cA Day in the Life of a Venture Capitalist\u201d (Stanford Case E-44, January 28, 2013) \\n\u201c16 Definitions on the Economics of VC\u201d, Scott Kupor, Andreessen Horowitz \\n\u201cSix Myths About Venture Capitalists\u201d, Diane Mulcahy, HBS \\nChapter 1 \u201cThe Players\u201d and Chapter 10 \u201cHow Venture Capital Funds Work\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson \\nSession 3: Developing a fund investment thesis \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapter 6 \u201cDefining Your Fund\u2019s Investment Strategy\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani \\nDoes your VC have an investment thesis or a hypothesis?, David Teten and Stephane Nasser, TechCrunch120 \\nCompilation of VC Investment Theses, Alexander Jarvis \\nA Short Guide to Impact Investing, The Case Foundation \\nSession 4: Deal sourcing and initial selection \\nRequired Readings:\\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned About Deal Sourcing, Danielle Morrill \\nHow VCs Source Deals, Allen Latta  \\nIn Defence of the Deck, Bill Gurley  \\nChapter 15 \u201cSourcing Investment Opportunities\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \\nSession 5: Due diligence \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapter 16 \u201cThe Art of Conducting Due Diligence\u201d and Chapter 17 \u201cManagement Team Diligence\u201d and Chapter 18 \u201cDiligence beyond Management\u201d, The Business of Venture Capital, Mahendra Ramisinghani  \\nImpact Due Diligence: Emerging Best Practices, Pacific Community Ventures \\nSession 6: Cap tables and Valuation \\nRequired Readings:\\n\u201cFinancing New Ventures\u201d (HBS Note N9-811-093, March 28, 2011)  \\n\u201cNote on Valuation in Private Company Settings (HBS #9-297-050, April 2002)  \\nChapter 7 \u201cThe Capitalization Table\u201d, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \\nSession 7: Term Sheets and Legal  \\nRequired Readings:\\nChapters 3 - 6, Venture Deals, Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson  \\nVenture Capital Lexicon, Series A Term Sheet, Singapore Venture Capital ASsociation (SVCA)  \\n\u201cVenture Capital Negotiations: VC versus the Entrepreneur\u201d (HBS # 9-800-170, March 2, 2000) \\nSession 8: What happens after the deal is closed: portfolio management through to exit \\nRequired Readings:\\nHow to Build a Great Startup Board: Part I and II, Reid Hoffman  \\n\u201cThe Secret to Making Board Meetings Suck Less\u201d  \\nMeasuring and Managing Impact: A Practical Guide, EVPA  \\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nClass contribution and attendance (20%) - based on general participation and in class contributions  \\nReflections on in-class dialogues/simulations (30%) \u2013 as mentioned this course will include \u2018dialogues\u2019 and \'simulations\' of parts of the investment process.

The approach propels students to look beyond the class content on the internet for project ideas, which give students ever-increasing exposure to the latest technologies around the world especially the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in product development. Through our own experiences with several PBL-based engineering courses (i.e., Design & Systems Thinking; Sensor, Measurement and Analysis; Integrated Engineering Project) and student-led engineering projects (i.e., E-Dap; Hearty Plant) at Fulbright University Vietnam, we notice that many students\u2019 projects are based on IoT technology. Furthermore, we also notice that in most projects, students have a lot of difficulty in finding a good communication solution for data pipeline between hardware products (e.g., sensors, actuators, controllers, processing units) and software controls (e.g., data acquisition and analysis, transmission of control commands) as illustrated in the following figure. The deficiency in the solution boils down to students\u2019 inadequate exposure to communication protocols and editions of database management system that are customizable and interactable with various control systems and web application servers. \\nIn general, undergraduate students could not develop such a communication solution for their IoT products from the ground up because of course duration, dependency on open-source platforms and insufficient knowledge in IoT technologies. On the contrary, the budget for a normal undergraduate engineering project is not enough to purchase expensive IoT solutions currently available on the market. \\nThese motivate us to propose this independent research project under the advisory of Dr. Truong Trung Kien, one of our Engineering lecturers. The project will focus on researching and developing a consistent, low-cost, student-feasible communication solution, enabling students to remotely control their products, automatically retrieve real-time statistical reports of the system and potentially develop self-monitoring algorithms later. We believe that the learning and experience in this research project will greatly assist us, as well as our engineering peers at Fulbright University Vietnam, to be more confident in developing IoT-based products in future engineering projects. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nIt is expected that after completing this independent research project, the students will be able to: \\n[Strong background] Acquire knowledge in the field of IoT and automation in engineering system with the appropriate breadth and depth in order to solve systematically corresponding engineering problems or to invent, design and build IoT-based engineering products. \\n[Proactive consideration] Design an engineering solution that meet specific needs of FUV engineering students with appropriate consideration of student development, educational environment, market requirements, and economic factors. \\n[Analytical thinking] Identify, analyze, and decompose compose complex engineering problems along with available resources, authentic constraints using principles of computer science and engineering sciences.\\n[Effective communication] Listen actively and present clearly to people with different backgrounds to deliver the proposed engineering solution through oral, written, and visual media. \\n[Productive collaboration] Work effectively and responsibly as an individual and as a member in the research group in an independent research project. \\n[Hands-on experience] Design, configure, test and evaluate the performance of an engineering system that integrates communication protocols of hardware and software of different engineering functionality, automated data acquisition and processing, and remote transmission of control commands\\n---\\nTentative Schedule and Workplan:\\n---\\nProposed artifacts for assessment:\\n1. A report of our research, design, implementation, and learning. \\n2. An architectural diagram of the proposed communication solution. \\n3. A workshop to present our proposed communication solution for engineering-interested students\\nGroup work:\\nTwo members in the current research project will work closely together and be both responsible for the following works: \\n\u2022 Desk research about the chosen topic \\n\u2022 Report of works and findings of the assigned research parts \\n\u2022 Updates of the project progress with faculty supervisor \\n\u2022 Completion of proposed artifacts \\nEach member will be mainly in charge of leading the following parts: \\nPham Hoang Lan:\\nResearch of suitable technological platforms for the aiming solution \\nConnections and communications between hardware and software protocols \\nSummary report of the research project \\nPhan Ngoc Lan Khanh:\\nResearch of suitable database management system for the aiming solution \\nAutomated data processing and transmission of control commands to the system \\nFeatures of sample interface presenting the transition of data and control signal from hardware to software and vice versa \\nThe students will be assessed based on their performance on the individually assigned tasks.

It has swung wildly from the liberal internationalism of the Obama administration to the America First nationalism of the Trump administration back to the more cooperative globalism of the Biden administration. How are we to make sense of this? What can Vietnamese leaders do to manage their relations with the US? This interdisciplinary online course examines the US position in the world in a contemporary and historical context to answer these questions. Over the duration of this course, we will examine how the United States has engaged with other peoples, nations and global forces; how other peoples and nations have seen the United States in the world; and how global forces have shaped the United States. By the end of the term, you will be able to explain American global behaviour and suggest ways in which other countries like Vietnam should engage with the United States in the global arena. This course will be divided into three units that build off one another to develop your understanding of the US in the World. In the first unit, we will examine the Cold War and how it shaped the American perception of its global role in the twentieth century. In the second unit, we will go back to the end of the nineteenth century to examine how the United States engaged with the people of the Global South, proceeding through the mid-point of the twentieth century when the global forces of decolonization intersected with the Cold War to push the United States into foreign entanglements, like Vietnam\u2019s war for independence and unification. In the third unit we will consider how the combined experiences of the Cold War and responding to decolonization set the stage for contemporary American global politics and what this means for the relations other nations have with the United States government in the twenty-first century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\n5.

Consideration will also be given to the influence of the \u2018nuclear age\u2019 on US cultural and social trends. The course will examine the political and moral dilemmas raised by the possession and possible use of nuclear weapons, the role they have played in the way the United States pursued its policies during the years of Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and People\u2019s Republic of China, and the domestic political controversies that US nuclear policies engendered. In the latter area we will consider the rise of anti-nuclear grass roots activism in the United States, alongside the place of nuclear issues in presidential elections and Congressional politics. We will also necessarily study some of the major events and crises of the Cold War, including the Berlin crises of 1948, 1958/9 and 1961, the course of the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis. The last portion of the course features analysis of the international negotiations over arms control and non-proliferation that have featured since the late 1960s and the controversies they generated.

People are interested in nature, the aesthetic, and the technological application of light. Light provides us with an omnipotent tool to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos, but a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life, including, but not limited to, food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, and medicine. Microwave for food heating, fiber-optic telecommunication for the Internet, laser for the massive digital data storage and reading, light detection and ranging for the autonomous vehicle, x-ray for medical imaging, fluorescence for food quality assessment, etc., are among countless examples of the light-based technologies. Those have been integrated seamlessly into our daily life, but we rarely appreciate how they work. The course aims to provide a solid background of the fundamental characteristics of light, its interaction with the matter, the mechanism of the light production, light transportation, and light detection. We will discuss technological applications of those aspects in light of the well-established and emerging technologies. We hope by the end, students will treasure the beauty of light and explore it as a sustainable solution for our common home, the Earth. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n\u2022 Some includes, but not limited to,  \\n\u2022 Understand the nature of light\\n\u2022 Understand how light is produced, how they interact with matter, how we can manipulate them \\n\u2022 Recognize the technical application of the light in the daily assets such as microwave, camera, x-ray\u2026\\n\u2022 Practical skills to handle the light source and light sensor\\n\u2022 Computing and data anlysis skills\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nTentative syllabus: for 6 hours/week in 8 weeks.

What makes paper, cloth, and plastic so different even though they are all organic polymers? What is the magic key step in both steel and semiconductor production? What properties make copper a great material for electronics and statues? Each material has its story full of ups and downs that involves not only science but also culture and economics. Their distinctive properties influence their usage in manufacturing and arts. How might these stories connect to you? What would be a perfect material in your opinion? We will explore questions like these, do some experiments, and have you look at the materials that make up your own living environment.

Instrumental analysis is crucial in conducting scientific research, evaluating the quality of materials including food and drinks, assessing environmental pollution and assisting forensic investigation, to name a few. In this courses, students will learn the science and conduct small projects using common instrumental techniques. They include Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Inverted Microscope (IM), Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and potentially others. FTIR is used to analyze chemical compositions and chemical bonds of a sample. IM with camera magnifies physical, chemical and biological processes happening in micrometer scale to observe and capture. RT-PCR monitors the amplification reaction of a targeted DNA molecule which can be used in numerous applications, such as quantifying microbial and vial load in a sample for the diagnostic of infectious diseases. ICP-OES is used to qualify and quantify chemical elements of a sample, especially metals. FTIR, IM and RT-PCR are available at Fulbright\'s lab. ICP-OES and other techniques are available at our collaborated labs and company.\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, students will:\\n\u2022 Demonstrate understanding of fundamental knowledge behind five instrumental analysis techniques: FTIR, Inverted Microscope, RT-PCR, ICP-OES and potentially others\\n\u2022 Demonstrate practical skills about using the above instruments\\n\u2022 Utilize software to visualize, analyze and calculate physical and chemical properties of molecules and materials using the above techniques\\n\u2022 Analyze data and present experimental data\\n\u2022 Writing scientific lab reports\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nTextbooks:\\nFundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering: An Integrated Approach, 5th Editionby William D.

We will read in order to understand texts as cultural artifacts specific to the time and place of their composition, and in order to investigate the sociopolitical implications of literary texts, both for their time and ours. We will read to foster critical thinking skills and to become better examiners of texts. We will read for aesthetic appreciation. We will read for the sheer thrill of it.

K. Rowling, Ralph Ellison, Italo Calvino, and Viet Thanh Nguyen. Our texts will be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone, Invisible Man, Invisible Cities, and The Sympathizer. We will examine theories of identity and otherness, and discover the origin of the Invisibility Cloak. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: \\nWe will read the entirety of Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s The Committed, his 2021 sequel to the Pulitzer Prize winning book The Sympathizer. (It is not necessary to have read the first book, since the plot is helpfully recapitulated in the opening section.) The Committed is a searing indictment of colonialism, and presents a nameless narrator who is split into three separate selves. We will also read the beginning third of Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man, the 1952 masterpiece on which The Committed is very loosely based. Like Nguyen, Ellison introduces a nameless narrator whose internal conflicts threaten to tear him apart. We will read most of J. K. Rowling\u2019s brilliant treatment of the subject of otherness and belonging, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone (originally published in 1997 as Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone), which painfully exposes the divide between wizards and humans. Additional texts introducing other theoretical angles on the question of invisibility will be brought in as necessary. Students will be evaluated on four things: 1) class participation throughout the course, 2) a short presentation, 3) five written responses keyed to the readings, and 4) two written papers, the first analyzing a small shared aspect of the texts, and the second providing an opportunity for a broader perspective on what is a wide-ranging subject of inexhaustible interest to human beings.\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nTexts:\\nJ.

Young people have been the backbone of post-colonial struggles, nation-building process, and various social and cultural movements across the region. Although there has been a growing interest in youth\u2019s relationship with broader social issues, Asian youth has received little attention in the classroom. This course aims to offer students a rigorous and comparative historical exploration of youth and society in Asia and to explore youth\u2019s significance in the region\u2019s past, present, and future. It begins from examining various theoretical traditions that conceptualize and treat youth in different manners. It then examines critical historical periods in which youth played a critical part in instigating or otherwise shaping major processes of political and social change in Asia. Finally, the course investigates and compares various relationships that Asian youth have developed with the state, citizenship and culture from a perspective that sheds light on the interplay of individual developments and broader sociocultural contexts. By designing and conducting a research project, students will be trained to be able to extend theories to issues concerning youth in Vietnam and Asia.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\n\u2022 Comprehend social and cultural developments in relation to youth\u2019s place and role in Vietnam and Asia;\\n\u2022 Use basic concepts and theories of youth from social and cultural sciences;\\n\u2022 Read critically the literature and other materials;\\n\u2022 Write and present academic research reports; and\\n\u2022 Reflect upon youth\u2019s relationships with the state and society in Vietnam and Asia.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nWeek 1: Introduction - Film discussion\\nWeek 2: Youth: concepts and theories\\nWeek 3: Youth in Asia\u2019s modern history\\nWeek 4: Youth in contemporary Asia: Northeast Asia\\nWeek 5: Youth in contemporary Asia: Southeast Asia\\nWeek 6: Youth and the state - Youth as citizens\\nWeek 7: Midterm quiz/exam - Film discussion\\nWeek 8: Youth and economic development - Youth and work\\nWeek 9: Youth and political participation - Youth and political representation\\nWeek 10: Youth and identity - Youth and gender\\nWeek 11: Research project presentations and peer-reviews\\nWeek 12: Youth and culture - Field research (Group)\\nWeek 13: Youth and digital world - Field research (Individual)\\nWeek 14: Research findings presentations and peer-reviews\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass participation -- 20%\\nMidterm quiz/exam -- 20%\\nResearch Project Presentation -- 10%\\nResearch findings presentations -- 20% \\nFinal essay -- 30%","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"18:30:00","end_time":"20:00:00"}],"location":"Action"},{"title":"Augustus in Saigon?

Particularly, the colonial past has been written into the urban space (in form of architectures, monuments, inscriptions, etc.) in a penetrating way. With it, Greek and Roman antiquities have entered and framed the peoples\u2018 and viewers\u2018 mind, too, either directly or indirectly. \\nThe aim of the course is to open these framed and framing spaces for a critical dialogue about the use, and abuse, of classical themes in the past and the way we can deal with this heritage in the present, and future. This dialogue will be triggered and established by linking classicized spaces in present-day Ho Chi Minh City with original artifacts of Graeco-Roman antiquity in a digital, interactive way. \\nBuilding on the concept of smart city, we will activate the students to critically deal with, and reflect on, the classical heritage by creating a digital exhibition via OMEKA that links the physically present structures with digital objects in a communicative, interactive way. This digital exhibition also enables the broader public to engage with their own past and to give them a handy tool at hand to live their urban space anew in the 21st century.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\n\u2022 introduction to theories and methodologies in history/art history/architecture (e.g., critical source analysis; discourse theory; structuralist- and post-structuralist approaches; frame and framing theories; image theory; social space theory; affordances; actor-object-networks; object-biography) [scientific competences]\\n\u2022 introduction to digital tool OMEKA (basic html-programming skills; cross-linking; design of digital maps, timelines, audio-video-files etc.) [digital humanities comp.]\\n\u2022 analysis of selected urban spaces and Graeco-Roman artifacts with respective research literature [scientific comp.]\\n\u2022 interpretation of innate narratives of the selected sources in critical manner [transfer and critical engagement comp.]\\n\u2022 creation of digital exhibition (by application of skills aquired from steps before) [digital humanities comp.]\\n\u2022 organisation and management of complex group-work (assignment of tasks and responsibilities; feedback culture; presentation skills etc.) [social and organizational comp.]\\n\u2022 audience-oriented presentation and marketing of digital exhibition (writing of appealing texts; balanced text-image-relation; logo / corporate identity design; etc.) [organizational and transfer comp., media comp.]\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nTopic/Content: Introduction to the topic \\nForm: Team-building activity / first orientation & examples\\nTopic/Content: Introduction to Historical Source Criticism\\nForm: Reflection on historical analysis and interpretation I\\nReading: J.

At the end of the nineteenth century, the \u201cnew woman\u201d pushed against the limits imposed by society. Following the footsteps of their counterparts in Europe and North America, the East Asian \u201cnew woman\u201d emerged during the interwar period seeking autonomy, redefining the feminine, exploring new ideas, lifestyles and behavior, and negotiating between the \u201ctraditional\u201d and the \u201cmodern\u201d. More than a century has passed but women of the 21stcentury still find themselves facing the challenges of negotiating between dominant gender roles and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. The course focuses on the dilemmas that women had to and still have to deal with in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression. In doing so, it specifically considers various structural, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped and transformed new womanhood of the early modern period and the 21stcentury. Throughout the semester, students will consider how social structures and cultural practices have affected women and also how women themselves have struggled for equal status and rights. Among others, the course explores various ways, resources, and outcomes of women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination. Students will examine a variety of texts with the aim of investigating the continuity and change in narrations on new womanhood in general and in Asia in particular.\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\\nComprehend the historical context in which the \u201cnew woman\u201d emerge during the early modern period;\\nRelate women\u2019s variegated experiences of emerging as the \u201cnew woman\u201d in the public sphere to specific national, regional and global contexts;\\nUnderstand women\u2019s dilemmas in their pursuit of liberation and in their fight against suppression in the early modern and 21st-century context;\\nDevelop analytical skills in examining women\u2019s constant negotiations between the dominant gender ideologies and desires for self-liberation and self-determination; and,\\nWrite and present academic research reports.\\n---\\nCourse Outline\\nWeek 1: Introduction\\nFilm discussion: \u201cTokyo Story\u201d by Ozu Yasujiro (1953)or \u201cSweet Dream\u201d by Ju-nam Yang (1936)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmd_OBPFll8\\nWeek 2: Women, education, and modern technology\\nWeek 3: Women, consumption, and agency\\nWeek 4: Women and modernity in early modern period\\nWeek 5: \u201cNew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\\nWeek 6: Colonialism, nationalism, and the \u201cwise mother, good wife\u201d ideology\\nWeek 7: Midterm exam\\nFilm discussion: \u201cYeongja\u2019s Heyday\u201d by Ho Sun Kim (1975) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPoTeWINSg\\nWeek 8: Women, development, and the state\\nWeek 9: Women, work, and power\\nWeek 10: Women, feminism, and the \u201c#MeToo\u201d movement\\nWeek 11: \u201cTiger mother\u201d vs. \u201cparasite single\u201d(parasaito shinguru) and\u201cKimchi woman\u201d (kimchinyeo)\\nWeek 12: Panel discussion 1: \u201cnew women\u201d vs. \u201cmodern girls\u201d\\nPanel discussion2: love, marriage, and new womanhood\\nWeek 13: Panel discussion3: women and the state\\nPanel discussion 4: women, feminism, and nationalism\\nWeek 14: Group project presentations\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass participation (20%)\\nMidterm exam (20%)\\nGroup Project (30%)\\nFinal essay (30%)","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Action"},{"title":"Language, Culture and Thought","id":"SOCI305_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Ian Scott Kalman","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OhQAJ/soci305spring2022s01","description":"Faculty: Ian Scott Kalman \u2013 E: ian.kalman@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: What is language - and could we even ask this question without it? Among all animals, humans are unique \u2013 not in our ability to communicate, but in the depth and extent of that ability. Language is not just about communication, words such as \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d can fundamentally change someone\u2019s legal and personal identity.  \\nLanguage is intimately tied to experience \u2013 the way we talk about an event has a bearing on how we understand that event \u2013 were those words \u201cjust a joke\u201d, or an insult? As much as language is something that humans produce, language is also part of what makes us human.  \\nThis course explores the complex intersection of language, culture, and thought through an introduction to sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Our course is divided into two principle units \u2013 firstly, we examine the history and core concepts in the study of language, beginning with philosophical questions on the origins of human language, the creation of linguistics as a distinct field of research, and the terms by which scholars have considered the relationships between language and culture.  \\nCore concepts include linguistic relativity, semiotics, illocutionary acts, and framing. In the second unit, we investigate language in everyday life. Core themes include power, gender, ideology, and identity.  \\nPlease note, this is not a linguistics course. We will not be learning new languages or emphasizing the technical components of syntax and use. While we will draw examples from many languages throughout the world, strong English reading and writing skills are highly recommended, as many core texts will be in English and draw upon English\\nLearning Objectives: Students Will Be Able To (SWBAT): \\n\u2022 Understand the history and core concepts in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology as it commonly appears in academic texts.\\n\u2022 Identify the role of language in their own culture and thought with increasing amounts of subtlety and depth.  \\n\u2022 Employ key concepts from sociolinguistics in oral discussions and both a written paper and exam.  \\n\u2022 Develop and execute a research project relating to language, culture, and thought in their own lives.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nClass Participation -- 20%\\nThird-Term Exam -- 20%\\nArticle Review -- 10%\\nFinal Project Presentation -- 20%\\nFinal Project Paper -- 30%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Science Lab"},{"title":"Global Political Economy","id":"SOCI307_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Jonathan London","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OUQAZ/soci307spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Jonathan London - E: jonathan.london@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Foundations of Political Economy and/or Principles of Economics\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCourse Format: Online\\n---\\nCourse Description: This course introduces theoretical and methodological approaches to the analysis of the world economy from the vantage point of global political economy (GPE), a multi-disciplinary field of inquiry that is founded on the assumption that economic aspects of social life may not be understood independently of politics and the broader sets of social relations and world historical contexts within which economics processes unfold.

We will investigate the central themes, theories, concepts, and questions of the contemporary study of comparative politics and explore the main theoretical, empirical, and methodological approaches to the study of Vietnamese politics. Why do nation states vary so substantially in their political freedoms and economic performances? What are similarities and differences that Vietnam bears from a comparative perspective? This course will seek to answer these big questions by developing an understanding of key concepts, theories and political system and policies of Vietnam. The course intertwines two major parts with Part I forming the foundation of the course by introducing the history, concepts, theories, and methodologies of Comparative Politics and the other exploring the actors and processes involved in the detailed case study, Vietnam. The course has a strong discussion-centered structure. Students are expected to read the assigned materials timely and thoughtfully and be ready to discuss the content in class.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: Students should be able:\\nTo demonstrate a basic understanding of the relationships between individuals, actors, and processes across different political systems both historical and contemporary.\\nTo facilitate and/or cultivate a sense of critical awareness of the world beyond their own.\\nTo develop a stronger understanding of fundamental differences between different regime types, the relationship between politics and economic outcomes, the role of identity in politics.\\nTo apply the analytical and methodological tools of comparative politics to political outcomes they want to understand and explain.\\nTo use these tools to further examine the political system and policies of Vietnam. \\n---\\nCourse Readings:\\nThere is no textbook for this course.

Vietnamese people were employing and localizing Chinese scripts and literary Chinese throughout more than 10 centuries (from the 10th to the beginning of the 20th centuries). As the official written language of the country for the composition of a wide variety of works, such as histories, literature, diplomatic documents, or medical treatises, this linguistic means helped the Vietnamese to record their thoughts and cultural values through times. The Vietnamese localization of the written Chinese resulted not only in new syntactic and lexical variations, but also in the emergence of a new phonetic system called Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) for Chinese scripts. Nowadays, words and morphemes rooted from literary Chinese may account for up to 60% of the vocabulary written in formal and scientific texts. Hence, understanding Vietnamese literary Chinese, and being literate in Chinese scripts obviously a key to comprehend Vietnam\u2019s past and present, to better understand the nation\u2019s cultural and intellectual heritage in East Asian contexts. Like the crucial role of Latin in American-European academes, knowledge of Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese words is definitely required for any student in Vietnam Studies in general, and pre-modern Vietnam research in particular.   \\nBased on Chinese scripts, the Vietnamese invented a new writing system, popular known as the demotic Nom script, to express their thoughts and emotions in their mother tongue. However, one cannot read Nom without knowing Chinese characters. Therefore, for Vietnamese people, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese characters means more than learning a language. It helps to bridge a huge gap between young Vietnamese learners and the historico-cultural textual treasure they are inheriting from the past. This course help Fulbright students to read, interpret, and better understand works composed in Vietnamese literary Chinese by Vietnamese national eminent figures like Ly Thai To, Tran Nhan Tong, Tran Hung Dao, Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du... and other key intelligentsias in premodern Vietnam who wrote about what happened in their times and their lives.\\nIn addition, learning Vietnamese literary Chinese helps to re-establish a cultural and historical connection with East Asia, not only with China and Taiwan, but also Japan and the Korean nations. It is worth noting that these days, the Japanese still use 2,136 common Kanji (or Chinese characters with Japanese pronunciations). Those words can all be found in Vietnamese literary Chinese introduced in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation (\xe2m H\xe1n-Vi\u1ec7t) along with standard modern Chinese pronunciation in order to have a better understanding of the similarities and differences of these two pronunciation systems. Students are also guided to use the dictionaries in different ways to be able to look up the vocabulary themselves.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: There are 3 basic Learning Objectives of this course:\\nHelping students understand Vietnamese cultural heritage better through Vietnamese literary Chinese texts.\\nHelping students to learn Sino-Vietnamese pronunciations of Chinese characters along with standard modern Chinese dictions, and to use Sino-Vietnamese words more accurately and effectively in modern Vietnamese language.\\nHelping students have a broader view of the culture and history of East Asian Cultural Sphere / Kanji Cultural Sphere.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 15%\\nQuizzes: 20%\\nMid-term: 15%\\nFinal exam: 50%","categories":["E1"],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Meeting room 1"},{"title":"Documentary Films from Vietnam: History, Theory, and Practice","id":"VS108_Spring2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Dao Le Na","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002Hz3OaQAJ/vs108spring2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Dao Le Na - E: na.dao@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: Not recommended for students who have not completed Core requirement.\\nCourse Format: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description: Documentary film has always had a certain appeal to the audience because it manifests the filmmakers\u2019 observation and point of view on real life. \u2018Reality\u2019, as Patricia Aufderheide mentioned in his book Documentary Film: a Very Short Introduction \u201cis not what is out there but what we know, understand, and share with each other of what is out there (\u2026) Documentary is an important reality-shaping communication, because of its claims to truth. Documentaries are always grounded in real life, and make a claim to tell us something worth knowing about it.\u201d Therefore, social issues of national identity, collective memory, gender, the diaspora will be effectively communicated to the audience through the visual expression of documentary storytelling.\\nThis course is directed to students who like watching documentaries and hope to make documentaries. The teaching team including Vietnamese documentary researchers and filmmakers will help students to focus on analyzing selected documentaries and practical filmmaking training. Students of this course will learn how to write a screenplay including find an idea and develop their ideas by multiple methods such as observation, field- notes, oral history, and narrative structure. Documentary filmmaking techniques will be trained by filmmakers through camera using, sound recording, log writing, and film editing. One of the course\u2019s features is that its students will make a documentary film based on Vietnamese cultural and social materials exposed to them during the course. At the end of the course, students will submit a documentary film in which academic knowledge can be utilized and integrated.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives: This course will aim to:\\n\u2022 The ability to evaluate a documentary film\\n\u2022 Understanding the values of national documentary film and the relation between cinema and national identities.\\n\u2022 Understanding how to explore and handle cultural and social materials in making a documentary film\\n\u2022 Finding suitable storytelling tools and aesthetic viewpoints for a filmmaker\u2019s discourse\\n\u2022 Finding a suitable style to produce their films.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to:\\n\u2022 Be able to analyze a documentary film and write critically about how the film presents its aesthetic form and communicates its meaning\\n\u2022 Understanding the history of documentary film and identifying conventions and elements of a documentary film\\n\u2022 Understanding current debates about documentary ethics and aesthetics.\\n\u2022 Prepare and submit their own documentary film in appropriate storytelling\\n---\\nCourse schedule\\nRequired Materials\\nBernard, Sheila Curran (2004) Documentary Storytelling for Video and Filmmakers.

This course looks at key texts in five core periods and epistemic traditions: (1) classical epistemologies and origin myths; (2) major transitions of the post-classical era; (3) Renaissance, Enlightenment, Revolution and transitions to modernity; (4) Modern Era; and (5) (Post) Colonialism. We ask, what exactly is change - be it creation, enlightenment, conversion, metamorphosis, revolution, or evolution? And we ask how have our ideas about \u201cchange\u201d changed over time?\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n\xb7      Students will be able to compose responses to texts related to literature, philosophy, religion, arts, in the forms of argumentative and comparative essays.\\n\xb7      Students will be able to explain the evolution of ideas and how those ideas influence social policy and shape perception in the contemporary world.\\n\xb7      Students will be able to critique each other\u2019s perspectives in the context of group discussions.\\n\xb7      Students will be able to analyze texts in ways that are applicable not only in the classroom but also in the professional world beyond the classroom.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nStudents are fully responsible for any missed classes and work.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future.\\n Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\n ---\\nLearning Objectives: After completing the course, students will be able to\\nUnderstand and practice the tools and principles of systems thinking and design thinking.\\nDefine the requirements of potential solutions and the quantitative and qualitative specifications of a system, with consideration for potentially related factors.\\nDecompose a system into deterministic components and functions, explain how they interact with each other and behave when integrated as a whole system, and explain how the system works within its environment.\\nBuild a working prototype and verify whether this prototype meets defined requirements and specifications.\\nImprove communication skills through oral and written presentations, sharpen teamwork skills by working with other students on term projects, as well as critical thinking while giving comments to others.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading: \\nMaker Space Training: 20%\\nTheory: 40%\\nApplication: 40%","categories":["Core"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"09:45:00","end_time":"11:15:00"}],"location":"Maker Space"},{"title":"Programming for Data Science and Visualization","id":"CS103_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Huynh The Dang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPZ8QAP/cs103summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Huynh The Dang - E: dang.huynh@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Math and Computing (E4)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description\\nThe Programming for Data Science and Visualization course aims at providing students with a set of skills to analyze the nature of data across different domains.

The course will be focused on the connection between different levels of intervention for the green planning and design, including village/district and relative technologies involved, especially the low and middle-tech, chosen according to the local conditions, culture and economy, what it is called Multi-Scale Approach. The discussion will touch several scales of design, from the bioregional scale down to the building. A common mistake in the discussion concerning the sustainability is the fragmentation of the planning. A single green building can not reach any results if it is not conceived into a large scale perspective. For this reason, the theory proposed in the course is the sustainability in a large scenario but connected with the local scale. Bio-Region, sustainable transportation system, Eco-Village and Eco-District, and finally Eco-Building will be connected with an organic plan, generating a general strategy where macro- and micro-scales are coherent and connected.\\nAn important part of the research will be the issue of the sustainable transportation. This mostly concerns the different modality of transportation, their structure and inter-connection, TOD system and Smart Node.\\nThe theory concerning the sustainability, Eco-Village and Eco-District will be both technical and theoretical. This teaching is based on a series of books that Professor Paolo Vincenzo Genovese published in the past years. Professor Genovese will apply his experience as a professional designer in sustainable district and Eco-Village planned in the Chinese context.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nTo analyze the complexity of the sustainability at large scale;\\nTo consider the sustainability as a complex system made by various variables. The students will be instructed that every possible solution in the field of sustainability could emanate only from the combination of different majors, including social, architectural, technological and economical spheres;\\nTo investigate real cases, study trips, workshops, focus on real projects and research at national and international levels;\\nTo communicate with government institutions and private companies to investigate some key topics of sustainability at both building and urban planning levels;\\nTo investigate the topic of Multi-Scale Approach at social, economical and technological levels applied in the local context;\\nTo develop study cases, theory and technology for Appropriate Technology and Zero Emission Buildings;\\n---\\nAssessments:\\nFinal Exam\\nThe exam will be based on an individual paper for each student for the theoretical part. The students will prepare also a project developed according to their own interests and with the investigation on the local context. The project could be individual or collective. The topic of the papers and the project will be decided between students and professor after a preliminary discussion.","categories":["E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"18:00:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"18:00:00"}],"location":"Online"},{"title":"Exploring Identities in Asia","id":"SOCI209_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Chang Yau Hoon","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPY0QAP/soci209summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Chang-Yau Hoon - E: chang-yau.hoon@fulbright.edu.vn \\nCategory: Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nFormat: Online\\n--- \\nCourse Description  \\nThe objective of the course is to provide students with a multi-disciplinary perspective into the diversity of cultures and societies in Asia, and to critically evaluate the various meanings and representations of Asia and Asians.

In view of the urgent problems of our time, for example, climate change, it is entrepreneurs who inspire hope with technology-based developments and thus play a central role in politics and society. At the same time, entrepreneurs are ambivalent contemporaries who are seen as role models and are envied because of their success but are also often confronted with criticism and suspicion. All over the world, entrepreneurship is increasingly popular and is being promoted by governments, international organizations, and local NGOs as an income-generating strategy or as a solution to so-called \\"disaster capitalism\\".\\nIn this course, we approach the anthropology of entrepreneurship from different theoretical perspectives. Starting in the middle of the 20th century, where on the one hand the relationship between entrepreneurship and social change (or the entrepreneur as a change agent) and the role of entrepreneurship in economic development were in focus, we follow how the perception and the view of anthropologists changed over time. Ethnographic examples range from Melanesian big men who became entrepreneurs, to ethnic, religious, ecological, and social entrepreneurship and to research on individual self-realization through entrepreneurship.\\n---\\nCourse Objectives \\nLearning objectives event\\nGetting to know theoretical debates and empirical case studies on entrepreneurship\\nIndependent literature research\\nStudents learn to critically question concepts relevant to the course\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes \\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to: \\nAcquire an understanding of the historical, political, and cultural context, current trends and future projections of digital technologies; \\nExplain basic concepts and theories in new (digital) media; \\nUnderstand the critical impact of media on a variety of contemporary issues such as privacy, surveillance, labor, and participation, as well as the construction of individual identity \u2013 gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality. \\nBe able to critically examine and utilize digital tools in meaningful and innovative ways. \\n---\\nAssessments\\nClass Participation\\nPresentation\\nSeminar Paper\\nLife Story Interviews (transcribed)","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"12:00:00"}],"location":"Classroom 4 & 5"},{"title":"Evolution of Vietnamese Society in the 20th century from a multidisciplinary per","id":"VS301_Summer2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Hoang Thach Quan","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002QXPXgQAP/vs301summer2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Hoang Thach Quan \u2013 E: quan.hoang@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCredits: 04 credits\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\nCross-listed: Vietnam Studies, Social Studies\\nFormat: Hybrid\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\n\u201cConnections are the source of life in Vietnam\u2026 [They] are constitutive of [the Vietnamese] self, community, and nation,\u201d observes a Vietnam scholar. This course examines those vital connections and the social structures that create, shape and sustain them. In doing so, we will examine how those structures have been transformed and changed throughout the twentieth century up to the present moment. In this interdisciplinary course, we will draw on a variety of historical, sociological and anthropological works to help shed light on the ways \u201csocial capital,\u201d to use a modern concept, is built (or destroyed) and human connections preserved (or severed) for countless generations of Vietnamese, past and present.  \\nAlthough the focus of the course is contemporary Vietnamese society and culture, any exploration of the present would be woefully incomplete without it being firmly anchored in the past, which for our course revolves around the traditional village and community that has been the life blood of Vietnam for the past thousands of years. We will therefore begin our course by looking at the traditional Vietnamese village structures and the social norms that govern the life choices and behavior of its residents. From there we embark on a historical journey that takes us through the colonial, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary periods until we reach the present time. \\nThroughout the course students are encouraged to think about the structural forces that deeply influence, or in most cases, dictate one\u2019s thoughts and behaviors, and the role and place of an individual in the larger social structure in which he/she is embedded. Questions that students taking this course may want to think about include, but are not limited to, the following: What are the sources of Vietnamese culture and identity? How important are human connections and how can they be preserved? Is one\u2019s identity permanent and fixed, or is it contingent, fluid and negotiable? Would a Vietnamese person today still recognize and understand a Vietnamese born hundreds of years ago? Is it possible to essentialize some quality (or set of qualities) that captures all that is Vietnamese?  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives: \\nThe course aims to give students a better understanding of Vietnamese society and culture and the trajectory of her evolution for the last one hundred years or so from a multidisciplinary perspective.  \\nStudents will be introduced to basic concepts in the humanities, sociology and anthropology. This will provide them with a wider and sharper lens through which to view themselves, their society, and hopefully also the wider world into which Vietnam is trying integrate\\nStudents will be able to interpret and analyze the causes and consequences of many common social, cultural phenomenon in modern-day Vietnam. On that basis, it is hoped that they will accordingly formulate an appropriate philosophical outlook and chart an effective and wise career path for personal development and social betterment after graduation.\\n---\\nCourse Schedule\\nSESSION 1 Introducing Key Concepts and Theoretical Framework to Understand the Trajectory of Vietnamese Society\u2019s Evolution \\nReading \\nT\xf6nnies, Ferdinand. \u201cCommunity and Society [Gemeinschaft Und Gesellschaft]\u201d in Jan Lin & Christopher Mele, eds.

After the past few years upheaval and distress, this suggestion may no longer seem very far-fetched. Concerns about social, ecological, and technological crises, when thematized, however, are often relegated to genres of fiction suggesting a certain departure from reality. If our circumstances have become similar to a \u201cwork of science fiction,\u201d then we must also take a closer look at how works of not just science fiction, but also horror and fantasy, rely on the boundaries between familiar and unfamiliar\u2014enabling us to imagine and cognitively process difficult questions that at first, seem uncanny and estranged from our lives.\\nIn this course, we will examine film and media primarily from East Asia that are concerned with the gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Through different genres of media, we examine how bodies, spaces, and even the Earth itself\u2014that we take for granted as familiar entities\u2014can become uncanny, strange, and alien. Our class discussion will take us from questions of environmental crisis and neo-imperialism in Bong Joon Ho\u2019s spin on the monster film genre in The Host, through the politics of the self and the boundaries between human and machine in Mamoru Oshii\u2019s Ghost in the Shell, and Huang Jianxin\u2019s Dislocation, to concerns about the end of the Anthropocene and human dominance over Earth in Chi Hui\u2019s The Rainforest and Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa, Valley of the Wind. This course will introduce students to a wide range of East Asian language film and media materials in translation. No previous knowledge of the region is required.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAnalyze films and texts, annotate with proficiency in filmic (visual, audio) and other formal techniques \\nWrite, construct, and present analyses into a clear, original, and persuasive interpretive claims, in both oral and written formats \\nConduct and present research in the art and media humanities \\nCreate original arguments that address the larger questions of the course \\nRevise and incorporate feedback and comments into projects and assignments from peers and instructors.\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n(topics to be reduced) \\n\\nWeek 1 \u2013 Introductions and the Uncanny \\nSigmund Freud, \u201cThe \u2018Uncanny\u2019\u201d (1919), 219-226, 238-252 \\nDuke University Writing Studio, \u201cWriting about Film\u201d \\n\\nWeek 2 \u2013 Heterotopias and the Monster \\nBong Joon Ho, The Host \\nTimothy Corrigan, Writing About Film. \u201cPreparing to watch and preparing to write\u201d and \u201cApproaches to Writing about Film\u201d \\nHye Jean Chung - Chapter 4: Heterotopic Monstrosity: The Host and Godzilla, 105-129 \\n\\nWeek 3 \u2013 The science fiction cityscape \\nHao Jingfang, \u201cFolding Beijing\u201d \\nMarilyn Fabe, \u201cFilm Glossary\u201d \\nLiao, Wang. \\"The Alienation of Spaces in Future China: The Case of Hao Jingfang\'s Folding Beijing.\\" Comparative Literature Studies, Vol. 57, No. 4, 2020, 686-701.  \\n\\nWeek 4 \u2013 Science fiction and Lost love \\nWong Kar Wai, 2046 \\nDonna Haraway: \u201cA Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s,\u201d 1-37 \\n\\nWeek 5 - Politics of the Cyborg self \\nMamoru Oshii, Ghost in the Shell (1995) \\nChristopher Bolton, Chapter 3 Puppet Voices, Cyborg Souls; pg 95-128 \\n\\nWeek 6 \u2013 Science fiction and Trauma \\nJang Joon-hwan, Save the Green Planet \\nChu, Seo-young.

We also see how transformations happen in nature and how human intervention transforms the natural world. But what about transformation that humans create through intentional design? This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

For example, computer scientists, programmers and engineers use computing systems in many of their every tasks. In principle, understanding of what is going on beyond the statements in high-level programming languages such as Python, Java, and C/C++ will help computer scientists and programmers write more efficient code. Similarly, such undertanding helps engineers interact better with their computing systems at the device or pin level. Thus, this is designed as the first course in computing systems for students who are interested in computer sciences and/or engineering majors at Fulbright University Vietnam. Its objective is to provide a strong foundation on the underlying structure of a computing system that the students can build on in later majored courses with advanced topics such as computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, databases, networks, signal processing, algorithm design and so on.\\nHow are computing systems are designed and implemented? In principle, computing systems often involve many layers of abstraction, from gates and circuits through machine and assembly code to software libraries and applications. This course introduces students to the abstract design and implementation of computer systems from the digital level in the hardware upwards to the interface between the hardware and the software. In particular, the course starts by revisting the concept of bits and introducing arithmetic and logical operations on bits. Next, it takes the students from the building of logic gates based on the transistor as a switch, gated latches to more complex logic structures. The knowledge is then applied to implement memory and a finite state machine. From there, students study the instruction cycle that the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows. As an example, students study a particular computer that is able to capture the important structures of a modern computer, while simple enough to facilitate complete understanding and hands-on programming experiences. Students also explore decisions and tradeoffs involved in the design and implementation. Applied projects and/or lab assignments might include the design and simulation of a CPU, and the tools used to program low-level systems.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives\\nUnderstand the underlying abstraction design and implementation of computing systems;\\nUnderstand how memory is constructed and explain the benefits of memory hierarchy;\\nExplain the fundamentals of how a computing system works;\\nTrace the excecution of an instruction in a simple central processing unit (CPU);\\nWrite codes in assembly language using standard programming constructs.\\n---\\nCourse Materials:\\nUsage notice: Course materials and reading assignments will be posted on Canvas.

If so, to what extent? What are the factors causing it? And what are we willing to give up to stop it? This introductory course offers students a first touch in economics as an economist, not a student. Rather than consider hypothetical situations related to climate change, we will actually compute the empirical realities. In this course we will put economics in the context of how it analyzes and addresses real-world issues such as inequality, discrimination, and sustainability through the interplay of data and theory.

This course is reading- and writing-intensive and is organized as a series of discussions. This course focuses on two main aspects: (i) the analysis of economic inequalities and (ii) the interaction between inequality and economic development. It will address the following questions from a theoretical perspective and/or an empirical perspective: \\n1. How does inequality evolve over time, and how does the evolution of inequality couple with the dynamics of economic development? \\n2. What are the determinants of inequality, and which theories can account for the level of economic inequalities and its dynamics?  \\n3. Which public policies can reduce inequality and foster equitable growth?  \\n4. How quickly does the level of inequality respond to a change in a public policy? \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nMajor Learning Outcomes (MLO): Students in the Economics major will:  \\nMLO1: Apply economic analysis to everyday problems, evaluate policies and the data supporting them, investigate arguments, and analyze the world in terms of trade-offs and incentives.\\nMLO2: Collect, interpret, and manipulate quantitative data to address real-world problems.\\nMLO3: Display a command of existing knowledge by explaining key economic theories and concepts and describing how they can be used.\\nMLO4: Work in and lead teams; ensure students can navigate diverse audiences and environments.\\nMLO5: Create new knowledge by identifying and formulating a question on some economic issue that will facilitate its investigation.\\nMLO6: Prepare for masters or doctoral programs in Economics or related disciplines such as Public Policy and Data Science at top-tier international programs.\\n\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nCLO1: Explain the key concepts of inequality such as the Gini coefficient, the coefficient of variation, the Pareto measure of inequality, the top income/wealth shares, and so on.  \\nCLO2: Develop a critical approach of the data and methods used to measure inequality.\\nCLO3: Analyze the determinants and consequences of economic inequality using appropriate theoretical models and empirical data.\\nCLO4: Evaluate the effectiveness of public policies used to combat inequality.  \\nCLO5: Propose appropriate policies to deal with inequality and promote equitable growth.\\nCLO6: Conduct independent research, especially on economic inequality.  \\nCLO7: Collaborate and work in teams effectively.\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\nPART 1: CORE CONCEPTS \\nWeek 1: Introduction \\nReadings:  \\nBenjamin, D., Brandt, L., & McCaig, B.

The aim of this course is to develop an understanding of the basic concepts of robotics, focusing on the construction and programming of autonomous mobile robots. The course uses a studio-based approach that tightly combines instruction in theory with practical implementation. After a review of recent developments in robotics, students are introduced to fundamental concepts related to robot mechanics, kinematics, sensor systems, and motion control. They are then introduced to high-level concepts related to robot intelligence such as path planning, localization, and map building. Students are also taught essential concepts and skills of programming. Both the robotic concepts and programming skills are reinforced as they work in a supervised, hands-on, team-based project. In this project, students work in teams to apply the conceptual knowledge and skills that they have acquired to the task of building and programming a robot in hands-on sessions. Students develop their project in the framework of the engineering design process\u2014from the analysis of requirements and initial design to implementation and testing. The course concludes with a contest designed for the robots developed by students. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO):\\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to \\nCLO1: Understand fundamental concepts of intelligent robot systems that will help them better understand the design and development challenges in the field of robotics. \\nCLO2: Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, construction and control of robots. \\nCLO3: Deepen their grasp of programming concepts and their programming skills. \\nCLO4: Gain hands-on practice in building and programming an actual robot. \\nCLO5: Program an autonomous mobile robot to achieve challenging tasks. \\nCLO6: Work as a team to complete different learning tasks that include practical and team assignments \\nCLO7: Effectively communicate their results via professional report writing and presentation \\nCLO8: Sharpens their analytical, planning, presentation and teamwork skills  \\n\\nEngineering Major Learning Outcomes (MLO):\\nMLO1: Analytical thinking: Identify, formulate, analyze and decompose complex engineering problems along with available resources and authentic constraints using principles of mathematics, basic sciences and engineering sciences.

Like many of the explorers you will meet along the way, you will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan\u2019s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age? How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. The aim of this course is to understand the big forces that pull the world\u2019s parts together as well as those that drive them apart. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects you to students elsewhere in the world. Across 22 locations around the world, students are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.\\n---\\nTentative Weekly Lectures:\\nWeek 1:\\nLecture 1: Peoples and Plunderers\\nLecture 2: Warfare and Motion\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 11\\nFirst Town Hall\\nFirst team meeting but no readings \u2013 just to discuss the format of teamwork.\\nWeek 2:\\nLecture 3: Clashing Worlds\\nLecture 4: Atlantic Worlds\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 12\\nSecond Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 1\\nWeek 3:\\nLecture 5: Indian Ocean Worlds\\nLecture 6: The Worlds that Merchants Made\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 13\\nThird Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 2\\nWeek 4:\\nLecture 7: East Asian Dynamism and the Seventeenth-Century Global Crisis\\nLecture 8: Empire and Enlightenment\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 14\\nFourth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 3\\nWeek 5:\\nLecture 9: The World in Revolution\\nLecture 10: States and Nations\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 15\\nFifth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 4\\nWeek 6:\\nLecture 11: Global Frontiers\\nLecture 12: Empires and Nations\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 16\\nIn-class midterm exam\\nNo Town Hall; no Team meeting\\nWeek 7:\\nLecture 13: Worlds in Motion\\nLecture 14: Empire Redux\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 17\\nSixth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 5\\nWeek 8:\\nLecture 15: Retreat of the Elephants\\nLecture 16: The World, 1914\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 17\\nSeventh Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 6\\nWeek 9:\\nLecture 17: Civilization and its Discontents\\nLecture 18: Worlds at War\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 18\\nEighth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 7\\nWeek 10:\\nLecture 19: Atrocities\\nLecture 20: Aftermaths\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 19\\nNinth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 8\\nWeek 11:\\nLecture 21: Recoveries\\nLecture 22: Inventing the Third World\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 20\\nWeek 12:\\nLecture 23: Crisis and Globalization\\nLecture 24: The Cunning of History\\nWorlds Together, Worlds Apart, chap. 21\\nTenth Town Hall\\nTeams to work on Case Study 9\\nFinal Exam\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nMid-term exam: 15%\\nFinal Exam: 35%\\nPrecept/Team participation: 50%","categories":["E1","E2"],"schedule":[{"day":"Monday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"},{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"16:30:00"}],"location":"Online"},{"title":"US in the World","id":"HIS108_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Vu Minh Hoang","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TFI46QAH/his108fall2022s01","description":"Faculty: Vu Minh Hoang - E: hoang.vu@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: No\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n*Tentative in Hybrid mode\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThe Spanish-American War of 1898 marked the entry of the United States into a new era of global engagement, as it administered populous overseas territories, engaged actively in spreading its liberal ideology and socio-economic vision, and reframed its conceptions of national and international security. Since then, it has become the leading global power, whose foreign policy not only disproportionately impacts other nations, but shapes the very structure of the international system. A grasp of American diplomatic history has become indispensable to anyone wishing to understand international politics from the beginning of the 20th century onwards.\\nThis course examines the evolution of American foreign policy through the 20th century, covering all the major events and debates of that time period, including the American decision to intervene in World War I and its consequences; the impact of America\u2019s isolationist foreign policy during the interwar years; the causes and consequences of World War II; the origins of the Cold War and American strategy; the creation and collapse of the American-led postwar economic system; American relations with allies and enemies in the Third World; and the United States in the post-Cold War World. We will also explore a range of macro-themes, including the role of ideology, race, religion, domestic politics, the institutional environment, and individual leaders in the making of American foreign policy.\\nThe goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of American foreign policy after 1898. Students will become familiar with important events, personalities, and theoretical perspectives. Students will be introduced to a range of opinions through secondary sources and trained to properly evaluate and use primary sources. Students will be expected to integrate these sources to produce two medium-length essays of five double-spaced pages each, with clear structures, coherent arguments supported by evidence where appropriate, and correct citation. Students will come away from the course with improved critical reading and argumentative writing skills, which are highly valued in most careers in an information economy.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nOn completion of this course, students will be able to:\\n1. Identify and state the significance of key individuals and events that have shaped US global engagement\\n2. Explain how ideologies like liberal-internationalism, imperialism and realism have shaped US global engagement in their own words\\n3. Explain how American actors have seen the world in their own words\\n4. Explain how other peoples and nations have seen the US in the world in their own words\\n5. Propose solutions to current challenges in dealing with the US in the world\\n6. Critically analyze and interpret primary sources\\n7.

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas.  \\nThis course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?  \\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nCourse Learning Outcomes (CLO): On completion of this module, students should be able to do the following (numbers of Major Learning Outcomes are attached in parentheses; see list of MLOs below): \\nCLO1: Identify the principal causes of the Vietnam War (MLO 1) \\nCLO2: Explore the factors prompting global powers to intervene, including the United States, France, the Soviet Union, South Korea, China, and Cambodia.

What does the world look like from the margins between states? The field of borderland studies puts those margins at the center of inquiry. In this course, we will learn how historically \u201cfuzzy\u201d borderlands in the Asia Pacific region became precisely bordered lands, or in some cases, disputed territories, in our contemporary world. We will also read from ethnographies and histories of everyday life to gain a deeper appreciation of life on the edges of the state. Readings will address a broad swathe of Asia with an emphasis on the borderlands between various states and the Qing empire as well as its successor states, including the PRC. Case studies will include Japanese-Ainu relations, Chinese migration to the Mekong delta, the making of Siam\u2019s modern borders, territorial disputes in Kashmir and Tibet, journeys through Mongolia, everyday life along the China-Russia border, and more. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nIn this course, students will develop \\nCritical thinking skills: We will challenge conventional frameworks for thinking about geographical space and human communities\u2014particularly, we will think critically about the framework of the neatly-bounded nation-state. \\nReasoning skills: we will think intensively about the best way to balance different kinds of evidence, including textual primary sources, maps, and participant observation data, while revising our image of the past and present.  \\nCultural knowledge: We will consider how life varies from one borderland to the next, and how life in borderlands may differ from life in the interior of a state\u2014particularly in the metropole. \\nEffective communication: Students will develop their writing and oral presentation skills with a historiographical paper, a research paper, and a final presentation. \\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek 1: What does a \u201cBorderland\u201d Look Like? \\nReadings: Elizabeth Kimball Kendall, A Wayfarer in China, ch. 6, \u201cTachienlu.\u201d \\n Unit 1: Frontiers and Borderlands \\n Week 2: Origins of the Field: Perspectives from North America \\nFrederick Jackson Turner (1920), The Frontier in American History, chapter 1. \\nJeremy Adelman and Stephen Aron (1999), \u201cFrom Borderlands to Borders: Empires, Nation-States, and the Peoples in Between in North American History.\u201d \\n Week 3: Comparative Asian Perspectives \\nReadings: Michiel Baud and Willem Van Schendel (1997), \u201cToward a Comparative History of Borderlands.\u201d \\nC.

It then moves into the emulation and modification of the Spanish model by other Atlantic imperial powers, notably Britain and France, and the general hardening of caste lines which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We also discuss the racial, religious and civilizational categories used by early modern missionaries, most notably the Jesuits, not only with respect to black and indigenous people in the New World but also with respect to civilizations encountered outside the domain of traditional imperialism in South, East, and Southeast Asia. We then discuss how these categories contributed to the formation of \u201cscientific\u201d racism and how the latter, in turn, intersected with a variety of nineteenth-century European and North American imperial and educational projects. We close by reading excerpts from postcolonial theorists who grapple explicitly with the concept of race and its future.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n1. Understanding the difference between a historical paper and an historiographical paper; learning to read multiple scholarly opinions and heuristics and rapidly identify the differences between or among them; learning to mine information on the educational background and historiographical school, etc., of contemporary and past scholars (e.g. this person is a member of the Cambridge school of intellectual history and therefore focuses on ideas in context, while a social historian will think about the experiences of past people, especially past subaltern people, and so on); writing fluently in the key of historiography. \\nThis contributes to the general goals of the major in terms of getting students to think historically, do their own research, read a wide variety of English-language sources critically, and so on. In general, historiographical writing requires less research than historical writing, but it is also more difficult because history undergraduates are trained to think of peer-reviewed journal articles and academic books as the \u201cword of God.\u201d Unlearning that and treating scholars as fallible historical people who, nonetheless, have done more serious research than any history undergraduate takes time and effort, and students will have to learn to read secondary sources much more closely and critically than they would otherwise do in order to construct an historiographical argument. They will also need to learn how to do creative research on the author\u2019s own biographies, for example finding CVs on university websites, reading acknowledgements pages, digging up juvenilia, and perhaps even interviewing the authors.  \\n\\n2. Understanding the degree to which European imperialism in its early modern/modern incarnation devolved on a) the introduction of religious-civilizational hierarchies unknown in the Middle Ages, which collapsed, to varying degrees, into racial-biological hierarchies b) the relaxation of prohibitions on unfree labor introduced during the Middle Ages. While imperialism, xenophobia, and exploitation were of course rife in the Middle Ages, as in any era, they did not take the racial and casteist forms which proliferated under Western rule c. 1500-1970, although other forms of casteism existed. Students will try to understand what made the ideological and material conditions for centuries of mass exploitation on an unprecedented scale possible. This course will also try to distinguish among the concepts of emperorhood, empire, and imperialism in a comparative context, focusing on the conditions which led to almost every Western European state declaring itself to be an empire during the early modern era, even states without a monarch.  \\nGrappling with the problem of modernity and/or Western hegemony is a subject which inevitably comes up in history courses which deal with material after about 1450. While other courses may encourage students to think about these problematics in order, for example, to construct a heuristic for understanding longue-dur\xe9e processes like capitalism or secularization, this course encourages students to confront the political, economic and ideological mechanisms of Western-led modernity head on.  \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeeks 1, 2, 3: Early Iberian Imperialism  \\nFrancisco N\xfa\xf1ez Muley, translated by Vincent Barletta.

Students will learn to read and write historiographically while, where appropriate, bringing in historical evidence (e.g. primary sources) in order to reinforce historiographical claims. The main skill emphasized here is learning how to sort through scholarship, identify points where there is substantial scholarly disagreement, and try to identify the sources of those disagreements. This involves learning to skim large amounts of scholarship in order to identify historiographical disputes at a glance, which is an advanced skil.  \\nFour introductions to in-class reading, presented and written with a partner, 300-500 words each, collectively 20% of grade. This assignment is intended to foster presentation skills and group work skills. In the case of readings which are older and/or notable among scholars (e.g. Black Skin, White Masks), students will be expected to work together to attain a basic literacy in the reception and legacy on the work presented on, as well as any controversies it may have generated. Again, this involves thinking critically about scholarship, learning about it as an artifact rather than accepting its contents as the \u201cword of God.\u201d  \\nClass participation, 20% of grade. Students will by the time of their arrival in this class have some familiarity with seminar-style discussion, but the goal here is to perfect it, to use questions from the professor as a jumping-off point for classwide discussion and not a simple exam question with a right or wrong answer. Students will be graded in part on their ability to engage with others\u2019 participation.  \\nFive interviews, collectively worth 10% of grade, 10 minutes each. Students will pair with a different partner from their partner in the introductions assignment for this assignment. Partners will create a 10-minute recorded interview in which they discuss what they thought were the high points of the readings and discussions of the past week of class. Interviews will be submitted the following Monday. These interviews are casual and are intended to improve: comfort with casual conversation in English; critical recollection and engagement with the material without instructor prompting; and level of engagement and attention in the class meetings leading up to the creation of an interview. Dead space is discouraged but recording many times to get a podcast-quality conversation is unnecessary.

But here we are! Biology as a field is advancing very rapidly and this course attempts to tackle some of the questions that are relevant to the current day and age by providing the knowledge and skills necessary. This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and principles common to all living organisms and their interaction with the environment. Through immersive integrated lab, analysis of real datasets from scientists around the world and lecture experiences, this course introduces students to the scientific process and production of biological knowledge encompassing how scientists investigate the cellular, molecular, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes that underlie life.

The tumultuous modern history of Vietnam (marked by three major wars, political division, unification, the destruction of one state, plus subsequent massive emigration of southern populations all over the world, as well asnormalization of international relations, and remarkable economic growth) has forced time and again, a deep and sometimes soul-wrenching reassessment of Vietnamese identity. Massive emigration over the 1970s and \u201880s following the Vietnam War, further complicated the question of identity, leading to large diaspora communities abroad with divergent values, aesthetics, and traditions. Throughout these upheavals, theproduction of short fiction, film, and tv have provided Vietnamese artists with a mirror of contemplation, a space for reckoning, and a canvas for the portrayal of alternative visions of Vietnamese life, society, and culture. Our class will begin with a range of short fiction produced at the end of the French period, in a time when Vietnamese intellectuals were struggling to imagine a new Vietnam free of colonial rule. We will then turn to depictions of the Vietnam war, and scrutinize both how foreign gazes represented Vietnam as well as how Vietnamese artists portrayed their own societies during this fraught time. Finally, we will turn to the postwar period, examining film, tv, and literature from both the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and contemporary diaspora communities, and ask how these artists imagine Vietnam and its future, in a time when the wars that tore apart the country are receding in memory.  \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nStudents will :\\nObtain a working knowledge of Vietnam in relation to its colonial and modern history\\nThink critically about narrative structure and their epistemological contributions across different media\\nMake important intercultural and interdisciplinary connections beyond the region of Southeast Asia.\\nProduce critical responses and essays in various formats (podcast, essay, video)\\n---\\nTentative Course Syllabus\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction & Narrative\\n-The Narrative Arc: \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d (https://thenarrativearc.org/plot)\\n-Suggested: George Johnson, NY Times: \u201cA Widening world of Hand-picked Truths\u201d\\n\\nWeek 2: Identity, History, and the Western Gaze\\n-Jamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cPreface\u201d\\n-Barthes, \u201cAn Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative,\u201d pp. 237-260\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Oliver Stone (1986), Platoon\\n\\nWeek 3: The chasm between old and new\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Vi\u1ec7t Linh, M\xea Th\u1ea3o, Th\u1eddi vang b\xf3ng\\n-Fiction: V\u0169 Tr\u1ecdng Ph\u1ee5ng, \u201cS\u1ed1 \u0110\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cDumb Luck\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 4: Beyond existing boundaries\\nJamieson, Understanding Vietnam, \u201cBattle of the Novels\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Khoa, L\xe0ng V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i ng\xe0y \u1ea5y (\u201cOnce Upon a Time in V\u0169 \u0110\u1ea1i Village\u201d)\\n-Fiction: Nh\u1ea5t Linh: \u0110i T\xe2y (\u201cGoing to France\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 5: Colonial vestiges\\n-Saada, Empire\u2019s Children, \u201cIntroduction\u201d pp. 1-3\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Kim Lef\xe8vre, White M\xe9tisse (including introduction)\\n\\nWeek 6: Interculturality and ambivalence\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Kim Lef\xe8vre, White M\xe9tisse\\n\\nWeek 7: Hope and Disillusionment\\n- Dror, \u201cLove, Hatred, and Heroism: Socializing children in North Vietnam duringWartime, 1965-\\n75\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Fiction: L\xea Minh Khu\xea, \u201cNh\u1eefng ng\xf4i sao xa x\xf4i\u201d (\u201cDistant Stars\u201d), \u201cBi k\u1ecbch nh\u1ecf\u201d (\u201cSmall Tragedy\u201d)\\n\\nWeek 8: Watching the Autumns go by\\n- Dror, \u201cRaising Vietnamese: War and youth in the South in early 1970s\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n- Nh\xe3 Ca, Olga Dror: Mourning Headband for Hu\u1ebf (Selections)\\n- Film: H\xe0 Th\xfac C\u1ea7n, \u0110\xe2t Kh\u1ed5 (\u201cLand of Sorrows\u201d)\\n- The music of Tr\u1ecbnh C\xf4ng S\u01a1n\\n\\nWeek 9: A Hard Morning\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh, Bao gi\u1edd cho \u0111\u1ebfn th\xe1ng m\u01b0\u1eddi (\u201cWhen October Comes\u201d)\\n- Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\\n\\nWeek 10: The Silence of Defeat\\n- Kilbourne, Cinema, Memory, Modernity, Introduction\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Ham Tran, V\u01b0\u1ee3t s\xf3ng (\u201cJourney from the Fall\u201d)\\n-Fiction: Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do\\n\\nWeek 11: Art and relics of history\\n- Nguyen, Khai Tu, \u201cCai Luong and the Politics of North and South Vietnam\u201d\\nPrimary materials:\\n- Film: Leon L\xea, Song Lang\\n\\nWeek 12: Memory and Family history\\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\\n\\nWeek 13: Reimaginations\\n- Fiction: Nguyen Phan Que Mai, The Mountains Sing\\n\\nWeek 14: Diversification and Exploration\\nPrimary materials:\\n-Film: Charlie Nguy\u1ec5n, Ch\xe0ng v\u1ee3 c\u1ee7a em (\u201cMy Mr. Wife\u201d)\\n-Film: Swann Dubus, Trong hay ngo\xe0i tay em (\u201cWith or Without Me\u201d)\\n\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nAttendance and participation\\nPresentation\\nCreative Reflection\\nMid-term paper\\nFinal project","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Wednesday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"},{"day":"Friday","start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:45:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 & 9"},{"title":"Pacific Voyages in Literature & Film","id":"LIT305_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Isadora Wagner","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002THKU2QAP/lit305fall2022s01","description":"Visiting Faculty: Isadora Wagner - E: isadora.wagner@fulbright.edu.vn\\nPre-requisite: 1.) one 100-level course in Lit (such as Foundations in Lit), and 2.) any 200-level Lit course.\\n\\n---\\nCourse description\\nStudents taking this course can expect to examine the transnational narrative rise, features, influences, and circulations of a distinct genre of literature, the Pacific travel narrative. By studying texts, films, and visual representations in the English language from the late eighteenth century to the present, we\u2019ll first learn how ships moved with increasing regularity on risky voyages between the world\u2019s oceans at the same time that novels came to dominate the literary world, and then turn our attention to the role of Pacific travel narratives in film, media, and prose narratives for expressing economic, military, and environmental anxieties in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As Michelle Burnham notes in Transoceanic America: Risk, Writing, and Revolution in the Global Pacific (2019), \u201cThese developments are related by their shared narrative dynamics, especially in the relationship between narrative suspense and numerical speculation, between words and numbers\u201d (23). Just as \u201cthe short-term risks and losses that attended these voyages were offset by their long-term profits, . . . the pleasure of accumulation concealed but also depended on the horrors of violence\u201d (ibid). Key authors include Captain James Cook, Herman Melville, Jack London, Amitav Ghosh, Nam Le, Lin Dinh, and films by H\xe0m Tr\u1ea7n and Nguy\u1ec5n V\xf5 Nghi\xeam Minh, among others.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\n1.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \\nSummary \\nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis.

We are spending more time and effort in borderless cyberspace but at the same time, dealing with issues in the multicultural physical space. Technology and society co-evolve, thus making it essential to understand both in order to grasp the best opportunities and also prepare for the upcoming challenges that arise from the ever increasing integration of technologies into our societies. While a discussion takes place among experts and in academia, foremost in the domain of Science and Technology Studies (STS), on the current and future social, economic, moral, legal, and political consequences, to the broader public, including early-stage students, these technologies and their implications can often remain abstract terms. One might have heard about IT, AI, big data, the Internet of Things, deep learning, or blockchain. Buzz words that we find frequently used in the international media. This course discusses these technologies, and systemically, in various sections throughout the semester, examines the social, ethical, moral, economic, political, and legal implications these technologies have and will have on societies globally. It will address critical societal challenges such as privacy, cybersecurity, misinformation, governance and politics in the digital age, media, business stability, ethics and morals in the digital age, and new modes of the workforce, among others. We will also look at internet governance as well as privacy protection rules in a global context for better understanding of global trends in building healthy relations between technology and society. Throughout, the course aims to educate students to think critically about the approaches and possible solutions to the challenges in the physical and virtual domain. The course serves as an introduction to these technologies and a moderate foray into Science and Technology Studies\' academic discipline. It should enable students to understand better the underlying technologies and the value of Science and Technology Studies (STS) while hopefully further arising interest in these subjects and into this academic discipline \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nGiven an introduction into the field of Science and Technology Studies.\\nProvide an understanding how academic profession studies technologies and technological changes.\\nUnderstand the complex relationship between technology, sciences and society\\nAnalyze important trends about the way and nature of current and emerging technological developments, allowing to gain an understanding on how technologies could develop further.\\nUnderstand the complex relationships between technology, sciences, innovation, economic, political and social dynamics, and societies\\nUnderstand how and why technology advancements have modified the physical and virtual environment of human societies\\nEnhance students\u2019 ability to approach complex problems critically, systematically and innovatory\\nDevelop students\u2019 capacity to position themselves in the emerging civilization age \\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek 1: Class Introduction.

It seeks to examine different theoretical perspectives on social movements and meanwhile exposes students to empirical studies of movements across the world, in both democratic and non-democratic states, with an emphasis on Vietnam. The key questions we will examine include the following: When and why do social movements occur? How are movements organized? What do movement participants think and feel? How do social movements work? How do authorities respond to movements? Why do movements decline? What changes do movements bring about? How do Vietnamese social movements emerge and grow? Any challenges ahead for Vietnamese civil society?\\nThe course will be divided into two main parts. The first devoted to theories of social movements and the ways in which our understanding of social movements has changed over time. We will also examine mobilization to social movements and ask why some people come to participate while others do not as well as the tactics  and successes of various social movements. The second is reserved for discussion of Vietnam\'s nascent social movements. There will be also experiential learning format in the course through which students will have the chance to visit an NGO in Ho Chi Minh City.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nAt the end of this course, the student will be able to:\\nExplain the main theories and concepts used in class.\\nLearn the analytic tools necessary to examine and critically assess the role of social movements in our society.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned in class to better understand historical and modern social movement causes and campaigns.\\nDesign a research project that incorporates a clear hypothesis, literature review, and data analysis on the topic of social movements.\\nCritically analyze and evaluate published research.\\nApply the theories and concepts learned to analyze emerging civil society and social movements in Vietnam\\nDevelop clear critical reading, thinking, and analytical skills.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nCourse Readings: There is no textbook for this course. All readings will be posted on Canvas and consist of book chapters and journal articles that either discuss key theoretical paradigms used in the study of social movements and/or apply them to specific social movements.\\n\\nWeek 1: Introduction: Conceptualizing Social Movements\\nTilly, Charles.

No freshmen allowed.\\n*Cross-listed with History (HIS), Social Studies (SS), and Literature (LIT).\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nIn this two-semester course (identified as Honors Praxis lab at the University of Utah, hereafter \u201cUU\u201d), students will engage in deep, critical analysis of the American War in Viet Nam and critically examine the war\u2019s legacies across the sites of mind, body, culture, family, environment, politics, and memory. The American War in Vietnam was a pivotal event of the 20th century. As time has passed and its survivors aged into late adulthood, we have reached a critical time to reflect upon that war\u2019s legacy and to engage in conversations with those who experienced and survived it. Their experiences hold insights into war\u2019s true toll, and the means to survive, recover, and reconcile in the wake of war. Unique to this course will be a transnational, multiplex consideration of war\u2019s legacies across diverse populations who experienced that war on \u201cmany sides,\u201d including Vietnamese and American participants in the fighting, protestors against the fighting, and a wide range of noncombatants who, despite being on the \u201cmargins\'\' of the fighting, nonetheless experienced war\u2019s toll. We will critically discuss how experiences of war and post-war migrations between countries constitute diasporic connections between Vietnam and America today. Through readings, films, guest lectures, and our own conversations, we will develop an appreciation of military veterans\u2019 and noncombatants\u2019 experiences \u2013 their memories of war, experiences of trauma, and sources of resilience. We will also consider the intergenerational and international connections \u2013 of suffering, resilience, and healing \u2013 that have arisen out of the American War in Vietnam. \\n\\nThis will be offered consecutively in two semesters, Fall 2022 & Spring 2023. The first semester is the time to provide students with multi perspective viewpoints of the war and its legacy, helping them to build a theoretical foundation for further research. The second semester will be conducted in a seminar style, as Fulbright-Utah students have figured out a research topic for their year-end final project. It will provide students with significant hands-on experience as it will lead them through various research phases, and show them how to present the outcomes of each phase effectively to an academic audience. Joint seminars will be conducted with the participation of all students from the two institutions.\\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\n-    Build a foundational knowledge of the geopolitical context, chronology, key figures, and events of the American War in Vietnam to situate that war\u2019s legacies. \\n-    Develop awareness of the linked cultures, social relations, and histories spanning the U.S. and Viet Nam that emerged through war, and an understanding of one another as populations whose lives are shaped and interconnected by war; \\n-   Comprehend how the American War in Vietnam, and other wars, have left enduring legacies upon critical sites of body, mind, culture, landscape, ecology, & society. This involves an appreciation of the many sides engaged in the war and the diaspora/transnational communities created by war.  \\n-    Engage in critical discussion and analysis of data, artifacts, and methodologies for describing and explaining war legacies, the strengths and shortcomings of these approaches, the experiences to which they give voice, and silence. \\n-    Through regular interaction and completion of shared assignments with team members at Fulbright University Vietnam and the University of Utah and, hone skills in cross-cultural awareness and communication, virtual collaboration, and team approaches to knowledge production. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\nWeek 1  \\nReview syllabus \\nOverview of course - themes, structure, assessment, Fulbright-Utah Student Teaming Up. \\nThematic Focus: Diverse perspectives and diverse legacies of the American/Vietnam War \\n\\nReadings: \\nGeorge Katsiaficas, ed.

Based on the complexity of the theories such as intertextuality, translation studies, cultural studies, deconstruction, and reception theory, adaptation studies allow audiences to consider the film adaptations as independent films with respective creativities of filmmakers by their cinematic language. Because adaptation studies are interdisciplinary, this course will not only instruct students on how to read books and movies but also move beyond comparisons of sources and film adaptations. Adaptation studies can be considered as a methodology and a field. Therefore, the class will concentrate on communicating film adaptations with the texts they are adapting. During the term, students will practice analyzing several Asian film adaptations to illuminate adaptation studies and learn about the Asian cultural contexts surrounding the sources and their adaptations. The outstanding feature of the course is that students will understand what film adaptations show and do not show in comparison with their sources to break the notion of fidelity that limit the filmmakers\u2019 creativities in their adaptation process. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to meet some guest speakers who are Vietnamese filmmakers, such as Viet Linh, Phan Gia Nhat Linh, Vinh Son, Nguyen Vo Nghiem Minh to listen to their own experiences about adaptation. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon successful completion of this course, the students will be able to: \\nBe able to analyze a film adaptation and write critically about how film adaptation reflects filmmakers\u2019 point of view and the context. \\nInterpreting why the filmmaker changed and revised the source literary work. \\nUnderstanding the equal relationship between literature and cinema \\nPrepare and submit their essay in appropriate research. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\n\\nWeek 1.

It will provide you with an introduction to Vietnamese Studies, which is both an interdisciplinary field and a transnational community of scholars and students in Vietnam and across the world. The course incorporates scholarship and methods from multiple disciplines, with particular attention to History, Environmental Studies, and Literary and Film Studies. These interdisciplinary investigations will be linked by our focus on the theme of development in Vietnam. In this course, we will analyze development historically and contextually; we will also seek to understand it not simply as an economic process, but also as a political, social, and ideological category.\\nThis course inaugurates a new collaborative learning partnership between Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League founded in 1769, and Fulbright University Vietnam, a liberal arts university established in Ho Chi Minh City in 2016. Throughout the fall 2020 term, you and your Fulbright classmates will be interacting and co-learning with a group of American students enrolled in a similar course at Dartmouth. Our two courses will function as a single \u201cconnected course,\u201d co-designed and co-taught by Dartmouth and Fulbright faculty, and using a common syllabus.  \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents who successfully complete this course will:\\nGain an introductory knowledge of the field of Vietnamese Studies and the major theoretical and practical issues in the field;\\nConstruct a working definition of the meaning of development, informed by the critical perspectives developed by scholars in History, Environmental Studies, Literary and Film Studies, and other fields;\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of the recent history of development in Vietnam (especially since the 1980s);\\nInvestigate key questions in the study of environmental governance in contemporary Vietnam, especially as it relates to development;\\nInvestigate how development has been represented, celebrated, and critiqued in contemporary Vietnamese literature and film;\\nWork in a team composed of Dartmouth and Fulbright University students to design and execute a research project on some aspect of development in contemporary Vietnam;\\nCollaborate with their teammates to produce a short film that presents the main findings of their research project.\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading:\\nAttendance: 5%\\nParticipation: 10%\\nOne-on-one interview assignment: 5%\\nOnline Field Journal: 10%\\nDartmouth-Fulbright Team Research Project: 60%\\nSummative Reflection paper: 10%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Friday","start_time":"08:00:00","end_time":"11:00:00"}],"location":"Art Studio"},{"title":"Contending Theories of International Relations: A Comprehensive View of Vietnam","id":"VS215_Fall2022_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Nguyen Thanh Trung","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002TF5f5QAD/vs215fall2022s01","description":"Faculty: Nguyen Thanh Trung - E: trung.nguyen@fulbright.edu.vn\\nCategory: Exploratory - Arts & Humanities (E1); Exploratory - Social Sciences (E2)\\nPre-requisite: Completed any 100-level History of Vietnam Studies courses\\nReading/Writing: Intensive\\n*Cross-listed with Social Studies (SS)\\n---\\nCourse Description:\\nThis course brings together International Relations theory and real-world Vietnamese foreign policy decisions and outcomes. The primary goal is to give students conceptual and critical tools to understand and analyze how theories of international relations, Vietnamese foreign policy outcomes, and current political events fit together. The course pays attention to the application of international relations theories to the problems we study, and also takes an interest in policy issues facing decision-makers in Vietnam as well as those facing decision-makers in other countries who deal with Vietnam. It is designed to develop students\u2019 capacity both to explain the foreign policy-making process in Vietnam, and to better understand the underlying patterns, logic, and implications of Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy in the world at large. \\nThe course is divided into three main topics. First, we will discuss International Relations theory that grounds Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy by examining the core international relations paradigms: realism, liberalism and social constructivism. It presents their historical origins, the evolution of their various branches (classical realism, neo-realism, neo-liberal institutionalism, etc.), and studies the contemporary application of the most important theories in the field. The second part of the class will examine the peculiar institutions and processes that guide foreign policy formation and implementation. Questions will revolve around who set the foreign policy agenda and what are the important institutions attempting to implement this agenda. Finally, the last third of the course will review some of the major elements and the more salient foreign policy challenges facing Vietnam since 1975. We seek to understand the security-based rationale of policy as well as other factors \u2013 institutional, ideological cultural, perceptual, and so on \u2013 that influence Vietnamese foreign policy. We also analyze decision-making processes that shape Vietnamese foreign policy, and Vietnam\u2019s relations with various countries and regions. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nExplain the major theories of international relations (hereinafter IR). \\nIdentify and describe the main similarities and differences among the major IR theories. \\nIdentify the leading authors in the IR field, as well as the theories, seminal works and key concepts they are associated with. \\nUnderstand the historical evolution of IR theory over time. \\nApply theoretical frameworks to understanding practical international relations issues. \\nAssess the behavior of actors in international politics in light of IR theories. \\nEnhance the students\u2019 understanding of contemporary Vietnamese foreign policy (hereinafter VFP) and its historical development through the study of Vietnam\u2019s relations with major countries and regions of the world, and also exploring the key issues in these relations. \\nProvide students with structured knowledge of VFP and enable them to independently explain VFP decisions by presenting the key principles and factors shaping VFP. \\n---\\nTentative Course Schedule:\\n\\nWeek 1: Course Introduction + What is Theory?  \\n- Stephen Walt. 2005. \u201cThe Relationship between Theory and Policy in International Relations.\u201d Annual Review of Political Science (8): 23-48.  \\n- Stephen Walt. 1998. \u201cOne World, Many Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy (Spring): 25-35.  \\n- Jack Snyder. 2004. \u201cOne World, Rival Theories.\u201d Foreign Policy.
