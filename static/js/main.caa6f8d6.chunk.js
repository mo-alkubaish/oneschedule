They can also serve as a medium for social change as images can spread awareness about important issues and, in the digital age, reach huge numbers of people regardless of the language they speak. To better understand how images function, this course introduces students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to interdisciplinary approaches to visual studies, culture, and theory. We will learn how to analyze, evaluate, and interpret images across multiple cultural realms, including art and popular media, public and political space, advertising and commerce, and cinematic and virtual worlds. \\nStudents will develop a sound foundation in relevant theories such as the gaze, agency, semiology, the exhibitionary order, and spectatorship. Throughout the course, we will also consider how visual technologies have been crucial to the construction and representation of diverse subjectivities, and how they have intersected with broader economic, political, and cultural developments such as colonialism and globalization. Topics will be organized through three interrelated and mutually constitutive thematic units: Technologies of Vision; Spaces of Vision/Envisioning Space; and Global Visual Culture. Each unit will be concluded through a project taking creative and critical visual and/or textual form. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nanalyze a variety of visual mediums through a critical lens\\nformulate arguments employing relevant theories in order to discuss visual texts\\ncompose essays that use appropriate vocabulary to interpret and historicize visual texts\\n---\\nSample Topic Schedule\\n\\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VISION\\n1.

Many of the texts and moving-image media we will read and watch together will come from various genres of comedy, melodrama, musical, and speculative fiction. Many of them also feature coming-of-age narratives against the backdrop and violence of war, migration, or rapid urbanization and technological change. Together, we will practice close analysis and critical interpretation while reading essays and fiction by 20th and 21st century writers including Xiao Hong, Eileen Chang, Sang. Young Park, and Chi Ta-wei. We will practice formal analysis while screening and discussing films directed by Toshio Matsumoto, Wong Kar-wai, Park Chan-wook, and Sung Hsin-yin.

Beyond the popular understanding of curating as exhibition-making, this course will focus on what it means to curate as a critical and creative practice, and how curators conceive of stories and concepts within specific contexts. By reading texts, surveying key exhibitions, meeting guest speakers, visiting art spaces, and doing hands-on assignments and practical training, students will explore the traditional, artistic, and multidisciplinary possibilities of curating.\\nWe will learn about the influences, controversies, and thresholds of curatorship within different contexts, both historical and geographical, aesthetic and political. Saigon will serve as a local context of curating practice, as demonstrated through notable exhibitions from the modern postcolonial nation-building period of the late 1950s, and the post-Doi Moi period of the early 2000s to present.\\nThrough such case studies, we will analyze how exhibitions intersect with political representation and aesthetic developments, and investigate in more depth how one can curate between different contexts, such as from the urban to the rural; from the national to the regional to the international; and from a historical perspective to that of the future.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to:\\n1. Explain the concept of an art ecology\\n2.

This might be a new mask that filters air in a superior manner, a drone that can deliver medicines to remote parts of the country faster than any vehicle, or an app that allows you to create new music depending on your mood. In this course, we showcase how innovation is linked to rigorous scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods, with an emphasis on teamwork and hands-on experience. Students may take this as an entry point into the deeper study of design and engineering, or they may apply what they learn in this introductory course to their understanding of social and economic systems, to creative fabrication in the fine arts, or to the design and development of a start-up company in collaboration with Fulbright\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This course embraces both the art and science of creation, instilling the confidence to experiment, sometimes to fail, but ultimately to prevail in designing and building a better future. Designing and Systems Thinking (D&ST) course introduces the principles, processes, and tools of systems thinking and design thinking that are used to identify and generate solutions to frictions in our society. The building blocks to understand systems and to approach the designing process include: how ethnographic observation can be used to frame and observe real world challenges from the consumer\u2019s perspective; an introduction to systems thinking to understand how challenges exist in a broader context; design thinking, enabling a structured approach to developing solutions and concepts; prototyping of physical products and designs; and key engineering concepts that enable concepts to become reality. This course employs project-based learning among teams of students to identify problems, specify client, consumer, or societal needs, and design a system answering those needs. This process includes defining the product\u2019s features and specifications, decomposing it into components, integrating it into an environment, building it, and then validating and verifying its results. For example, teams may create elements of a smart home like automatic lighting and watering, or an Internet of Things (IoT) system for drought monitoring and early warning, or an automatic hand sanitizer. They will use modules, materials, tools, and facilities available in the market or in the Fulbright Maker Space to prototype these systems. In the process, they will develop a basic command of agile methods used in project management, learn basic modern fabrication skills, and practice critical thinking, including an understanding of constraints, negotiating between options, and examining social and environmental impact.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After completing the course, students will be able to\\n1.

Accountability, school choice, charter schools, vouchers, privatization, merit pay for teachers, and school funding are just a few noteworthy examples. This course will explore how economists think about education in general as well as these specific policies and the underlying economic theories. We will address the following questions:\\n* What concepts, theories, perspectives, methods, and insights do economists bring to education policy debates, in both K-12 and higher education?\\n* How is economic thinking used to support and/or oppose specific educational policies? To what extent and in what ways does school choice \u201cincrease competition\u201d among schools? Is there a teacher shortage? If so, how might it be eliminated? How can schools attract high quality teachers? Do too many, or too few, students go on to college?\\n* What are the most important research studies conducted by economists of education? What have these contributed to our understanding of education?

By definition, a signal is any observable change in quantity over space or time. It could help observers to obtain information about a phenomenon. In nature, signals can be actions done by organisms to alert other organisms or sounds or motions by animals to alert other animals of danger or food. Advances in technology have improved the capabilities of human beings to identify, analyze and even synthesize diverse information sources such as audio (speech, acoustics, music), image (photos, videos, multimedia, medical scans), medical signals (heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity) and remote sensing data (geophysical, sensing, radar). In principle, signals could be represented as data values or abstractly as mathematical expressions. A system converts or manipulate an input signal into an output signal. Examples of systems are face recognition, video streaming, cellular phones, and smart homes. In this course, students will learn to use mathematical theory and computer simulation to develop models, to analyze and to manipulate signals and systems that vary in continuous-time and discrete time. Specifically, the course covers representation of signals and systems, systems properties, conversion between continuous-time and discrete-time, Laplace, Fourier and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, feedback and control systems. Students will gain hands-on experience on how to process various types of signals and to analyze and design systems by computer simulation using MATLAB or a similar software package.\\n---\\nCourse Learning Outcomes: After the course, students will be able to\\n1. Demonstrate understanding of the key concepts and mathematical representation models of signals and systems.\\n2. Strengthen their engineering skills involved in the design, analyze and simulation of systems process input signals in order to produce the desired outputs or to control the systems\u2019 behaviors.\\n3.

During this timespan, the wars in Vietnam evolved from anti-colonial struggle to superpower confrontation and were central to the decades-long global encounter known as the Cold War. As the struggle for Vietnam grew in intensity and complexity, it took on increasingly global implications, drawing in a diverse range of rival states, citizens\u2019 movements, and other non-state actors whose interpretations and responses to the war were conditioned by a variety of competing local agendas. This course will assess critical historiographical questions, including: What were the Vietnamese, origins of the conflict? How and why did anti-colonial Vietnamese become so divided? Why did Cold War superpowers commit so much to a small, distant country? What role did the larger Cold War play in shaping overseas powers\u2019 decision-making? What was impact of each party\u2019s respective domestic politics? How and why did the conflict end the way it did? How did it shape the politics and economy of the region? And what are the global legacies of the war?\\nThe course will consider the Vietnam War as first and foremost a Vietnamese conflict, one which acquired increasingly global significance. In addition to exploring the domestic causes and dynamics of the Vietnam War, we will also consider the conflict - a seminal episode in the global Cold War - as a lens for analyzing a wide range of international events and trends. These include Empire and Decolonization; the Non-Aligned Movement; the Chinese Civil War; the American \u201cRed Scare\u201d; the Korean War; Development and Modernization Theory; the Sino-Soviet Split; China\u2019s Cultural Revolution; Detente; the rise of the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d; the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian Genocide; and the aftermaths, legacies, and interpretations of the conflict.\\nThis course is a continuation of HIS208 The Global War Part I, taught during the Autumn semester.

Nonetheless, both the First Republic (1955-1963) and the Second Republic (1967-1975) had millions of supporters and were shaped by leaders and contributors who, whatever else, held sincere visions for what a constitutional, pluralistic Vietnam south of the Seventeenth Parallel might look like. This course provides a detailed assessment of the history of the Republic of Vietnam, beginning with its intellectual and political origins during the mid-colonial period through to its fraught manifestation and ultimate disintegration in the midst of a conflict that had evolved into a global Cold War struggle. In so doing we will examine the politics, economics, and culture of the Republic of Vietnam, addressing how and why the Republic came into being; the basis of Republican visions and ideology; and the nature and causes of the Republic\u2019s abrupt collapse from within in the fateful spring of 1975.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: On completion of this module, students should be able to:\\n\u2022 To engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks for understanding the history of the Republic of Vietnam\\n\u2022 To evaluate important methodological and historiographical trends relating to this time period.\\n\u2022 Analyse a range of relevant primary and secondary sources.\\n\u2022 Apply the skills acquired in formulating nuanced and sophisticated arguments supported by historical evidence.\\n\u2022 Apply transferable skills including effective written and oral communication, time management, and project management and completion, among others.\\n\u2022 Demonstrate critical thinking and analytical skill, and the ability to articulate complex ideas and interpretations verbally and in writing.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nWeek One: Ideological Origins of Republicanism\\nReadings from Peter Zinoman, Christopher Goscha, Tuan Hoang, Agathe Larcher-Goscha\\n\\nWeek Two: The Colonial Bourgeoisie\\nReadings from Martina Nguyen, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Patricia Norland, Anthony Morreale\\n\\nWeek Three: Urban and Rural Vietnam\\nReadings from Hayden Cherry, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Gerard Sasges\\n\\nWeek Four: Print Media\\nReadings from Philippe Peycam, Shawn McHale, Hue-Tam Ho Tai\\n\\nWeek Five: The First Republic: Origins\\nReadings from Edward Miller, Jessica Chapman, Nguyen Phi-Van, Duy Lap Nguyen\\n\\nWeek Six: The First Republic: Development\\nReadings Edward Miller, Philip Catton, Geoff Stewart\\n\\nWeek Seven: Constitutionalism\\nReadings from Nu-Anh Tran, Edward Miller, Do Mau, Duong Thi Mai Elliott\\n\\nWeek Eight: Opposition and Protest\\nReadings from Edward Miller, Vu Van Mau, Arthur Dommen\\n\\nWeek Nine: A Turbulent Interregnum\\nReadings from Robert Topmiller, An Nguyen, Vo Long Trieu,\\n\\nWeek Ten: The Second Republic: Origins\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Jay Veith, Charles Joiner, Allan Goodman\\n\\nWeek Eleven: The Second Republic: Power and Protest\\nReadings from Sean Fear, An Nguyen, Nguyen Phi-Van, Tran Van Tuyen\\n\\nWeek Twelve: The Second Republic: Culture and Society\\nReadings from Olga Dror, Ngo Vinh Long, Jason Gibbs, John Schafer\\n\\nWeek Thirteen: The Second Republic: Collapse from Within?\\nReadings from Sean Fear, Dang Van Sung, Nguyen Be, Nha Ca\\n\\nWeek Fourteen: Aftermaths and Legacies\\nReadings from Nguyen Thien Y, Bui Diem, Cao Xuan Huy, Sam Vong\\n---\\nAssessments & Grading\\nFormative Writing Assignment 20%\\nResearch Essay 30%\\nOnline exam 30%\\nAttendance and participation (including in-class exercises and presentations) 20%","categories":[],"schedule":[{"day":"Tuesday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"},{"day":"Thursday","start_time":"16:45:00","end_time":"18:15:00"}],"location":"Classroom 8 & 9"},{"title":"HIS Capstone II","id":"HIS402_Spring2023_S01","credits":"4","instructor":"Offering Status","url":"https://onestop.fulbright.edu.vn/s/course-offering/a046F00002X92izQAB/his402spring2023s01","description":"This course is for the students who got Major Advisor\'s approval for the Capstone project in Year 4 at Fulbright. \\nPlease contact your Major Advisor to plan and complete your capstone.

To shape the future, we need creative and interdisciplinary minds with knowledge of science and technology to develop, implement smart technological solutions in our modern society. The most ubiquitous smart device arguably is the smartphone. Physics is the foundation on which those emerging technologies came to exist and have brought about a revolution in the way we communicate and find our way around. The rise of smart appliances and devices for domestic use has changed the way we interact in our daily activities. Understanding how these technologies work, especially with the laws of physics at play, students may develop a profound understanding of these everyday devices and may even appreciate the way they function and perform which alter life for the better. In particular, the smartphone is becoming more sophisticated, versatile, and packed with many advanced technologies on a smaller and smaller scale. In this course we examine how the smartphone glorifies many scientific and technological advancements. These technologies including semiconductor nanotechnology, sensors, fiber optics, satellites, and even atomic clocks form the main subjects to be explored in this course.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: At the completion of this course, the student will:\\n1) Be able to identify a device as a smart device\\n2) Be capable of recognizing various essential components of a smart device\\n3) Understand the fundamental principles and the functions of the core components of a smart device\\n4) Understand the interrelations and/or interconnections of smart devices with the external information networks and the users.\\n5) Appreciate everyday smart devices for the way they function and perform which alter life for the better.\\n6) Foster technical writing and presentation skills.\\n---\\nTentative Schedule\\nReading Materials for each week will be provided separately.\\nWeek 1: Physics of smart device in a nutshell: (1) what is a smart device, (2) inside a smart device (as in a smartphone), (3) Outlines of physics principles that enable these components.

Through texts, both fiction and non-fiction, we chart the emergence of the \u2018modern\u2019 fashion system and learn how fashion mediates our understanding of a literary text. By the 1860s, fashion had become an integral part of daily urban life, an expression of modernity itself in the words of French poet Charles Baudelaire. Why did, for instance, canonical writers like Charles Baudelaire and Colette also happen to work as fashion journalists?\\nIn what ways did the cultural mapping of fashion conducted by these writers from three distinct geographic areas diverge and converge? Why do so many modernist texts in the 20th century revolve around themes of dress? At once social, economic, political, and aesthetic in nature, fashion provides us with a unique lens through which to examine literature and culture. Key themes explored in the course include: rise of the modern city; gender and identity; class and capital; fashion and the environment. Some of the texts studied in the course include but are not limited to: \u201cSartor Resartus\u201d (Thomas Carlyle), \u201cPainter of Modern Life\u201d (Baudelaire), Ladies Paradise (Zola), Orlando (Virginia Woolf) and Banjo: A Story without a Plot (Claude McKay), among others.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: After successful completion of the course, students will be able to:\\n1.

better understand aspects of everyday life and to address broader social problems and issues. These include intimate relationships, sexuality, leadership, work, teams, environmental problems, popular culture, body image, digital gaming, social media, addiction and the conflict between traditional values and modern lifestyles. These topics will be explored in relation to our sense of self and identity, social interactions, intergroup relationships, how people develop knowledge of the world and the situated nature of human existence. The course assumes that social psychology is more than a spectator sport by making links between theory, research and action. Guiding such work is the proposition that human beings have innate dignity and should be afforded equitable chances to flourish in life.\\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSession 01: Introduction to Applied Social Psychology\\nReadings:\\nHodgetts, D., Stolte, O., Sonn, C., Drew, N., Carr, S., & Nikora, L.

Humans are unique among living beings in the scale and complexity of our social formations. Through society, we make the worlds we live in - we cultivate identities, families, language, morality, governments, wealth, religions, and so forth. Society makes these things and makes them meaningful; society can turn a piece of paper into money, and money into something people will spend their lives pursuing. Thus, society can and must be studied, and studied with all empirical tools available to researchers. This course, Social Inquiry, provides an introductory survey to the questions and topics at the heart of the social sciences.  Unit one focuses on longstanding questions such as \u201cwhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cwhy do we have society in the first place?\u201d and \u201cdo individuals make society, or does society make individuals?\u201d, while unit two explores specific topics of interest to social scientists. Some topics for inquiry include: identity, gender and sexuality, economy, politics, inequality, family, law, and language. This course is a required foundational course for the Social Studies major and may be of interest to anyone fulfilling their exploratory requirements as well. \\n---\\nLearning Objectives:\\nStudents will be able to demonstrate familiarity with key topics and research approaches in the social sciences through exams and response papers \\nStudents will be able to understand and employ basic concepts in social science research methods such as \u201csociety\u201d in order to interpret fundamental texts \\nStudents will be able to present and discuss social issues that concern their lives \\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2VW_ACdTlNzySiySyfPfOrgxQztprrzGxxL_2pfo5Q/edit?usp=sharing \\nSummary \\nUnit One: Foundational Questions \u2013 This unit focuses on core questions, and a few core ideas across the social sciences. The primary text is David Graeber and David Wengrow\u2019s recent, The Dawn of Everything, but students will also read selections from Max Weber, Marcel Mauss, Emile Durkheim, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Erving Goffman, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict. Each week is organized around a key question such as: \u201cWhat is society?\u201d \u201cDo people make society?\u201d \u201cDoes society make people?\u201d \u201cWhat is human nature\u201d, \u201cWhat is human culture\u201d, and \u201cWhat type of science is social science?\u201d This unit will culminate in a midterm exam focusing on foundational concepts in the social sciences.  \\n Unit Two: The Human Experience \u2013 This unit focuses on key topics in social scientific research. Each week focuses on a different topic with readings highlighting contemporary and interesting research related to those topis. Different iterations of the class can select form a list of topics depending upon the instructor\u2019s preference. These topics include: Food, Sex, Death, Wealth, Nations, Power, Religion, Language, Law, Morality, Race.

The course charts the evolution of ethnographic films from their initial concerns with representing the \u201cOther\u201d to their shifted attention to reflexivity and the politics of knowledge production across cultural boundaries. Throughout the course, we will be addressing various ethical, formal, and thematic concerns underlying contemporary thinking about ethnographic filmmaking. A variety of experimental ethnographic film and video makers will be introduced in weekly lectures and screenings. In the course of the semester, students will also be researching, assembling material, interviewing, and editing three short assignments and a final project that responds to the different thematical focuses. The formats utilized to produce these projects may include single-channel video, interactive video, or video installation. \\n---\\nLearning Outcomes:\\nThis course aims to move beyond the fundamentals of ethnographic filmmaking toward the identification of this genre as an interdisciplinary art form, intricately intertwined with other disciplines of art and regimes of representation. As such, after successful completion of this course, students will be able to: \\n1. Comprehend foundational terminologies and techniques in ethnographic filmmaking.\\n2. Distinguish the major developments in the field of visual anthropology as related to the form of ethnographic film.\\n3. Interpret and apply social inquiries to cinematic language.\\n4.

This course analyzes the various aspects of sex from the perspective of two subfields of anthropology: sociocultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology. This includes but is not limited to: social and linguistic constructions of sex and gender; gendered violence; power and language; the regulation of sex; and the queering of sex.

It could as well be deeply latent inside the personal consciousness or at the hidden corner of the social collective mind. How will those quasi-transparent and subterranean features look like when they are visualized into such a grand expressive audio-visual art form as cinema? That is the first question for examination inside this course. By zooming into Vietnamese identities on contemporary Vietnamese big screen, the course is to carry out a thorough surgery on this matter of a \u201cnation in transition\u201d (William Lim, 2001) in the complex postmodern global context. This course focuses on the identity literacy for those who would like to take it seriously on Vietnam studies and particularly those who are interested in researching them through film aesthetics. First and foremost, it examines what identity is under theoretical viewpoint as well as its major attributed components as gender, race, class, and nation. In parallel, it re-examines what Vietnamese identities have been and what are the new layers of Vietnamese identities which are being reconstructed in the contemporary epoch.\\nAfter providing a brief knowledge on film aesthetics, the course will make use of those understandings to analyze and critique how contemporary Vietnamese filmmakers (of the 21st century) convey their personal as well as collective Vietnamese identities through each filmmaker\u2019s aesthetic choices. Those are not historical lessons on Vietnamese cinema since its birth but zooming into the contemporary Vietnamese film instead. More precisely, after the U.S opened the embargo with Vietnam, which opened a new chapter for the country in transition, the new epoch of Vietnamese cinema has also been opened, with a booming market and a radical of art-house and experimental genres having been emerged. For nearly thirty years, a new wave of contemporary filmmakers in Vietnam have been reinventing various aesthetic choices of the classic world cinema in order to shape a new face of Vietnamese cinema as well as Vietnamese collective identities. Hence, reading the embedded Vietnamese identities being embedded on Vietnamese big screen can\u2019t be distinguished from reading how Vietnamese cinema has been transformed aesthetically.\\nBy reading theories and defining specific cases on personal and collective identities on Vietnamese cinema inside its present socio-political context, this course aims to provide students a full and well-rounded understandings on the complex Vietnamese identities at the moment. Also, by the end of this course, students are expected to grasp a more well-rounded knowledge on cinema aesthetics and the way a film\u2019s visual and aural features are used to create essentially non-narrative dimensions of film, including the film\u2019s \u2018look\u2019.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students in this course will:\\n1. Evaluate Vietnamese identities and how contemporary Vietnamese films applying different aesthetics to convey its embedded identities.\\n2. Understand the distinctions between personal, collective and national identities and how they are conveyed as a part of film politics.\\n3. Explore Vietnamese complex socio-cultural materials for future courses of Vietnamese studies as well as film studies.\\n4. Write critiques on films in formal academic form with full understandings of film language.\\n5. Gain knowledge of the living history of contemporary Vietnamese film scene and identify conventions and elements of their aesthetics\\n6.

Students will first learn what \u201ctransdisciplinarity\u201d and \u201carea/regional studies\u201d are, what regional studies we are talking about when talking about Vietnam, and why they are playing important roles in our understanding of the country and its people. Key concepts in social sciences and the humanities (such as \u201cpower,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cnation-state,\u201d \u201cnational identity,\u201d \u201cnational pride,\u201d \u201ccolonial mentality,\u201d \u201cinferiority complex,\u201d or \u201cglobalization\u201d) will be discussed to create a basic theoretical foundation for further understanding of multiple \u201cVietnams\u201d in the making. Students will have the opportunity to examine a few case studies, approve or question their research outcomes with a critical mind. Students will also have a chance to learn about local studies, recognizing the importance of the studies of urban centers and rural areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City (formerly, Saigon), Hue, Hanoi, or the Mekong Delta that will enrich their comprehension of those places and of Vietnam, in general. Students will be exposed to \u201cVietnamese Studies\u201d currently practiced inside and outside Vietnam to realize which approaches have been employed in this interdisciplinary field, and how the field significantly varies in different geo-political, socio-cultural environments, depending on who is doing it and in which contexts it is carried out. A wide array of (re)sources for study and research will be introduced. Finally, students will have a chance to redefine \u201cVietnam Studies\u201d at Fulbright University Vietnam and figure out which directions it is heading towards. This course is open to VS majors and non-majors.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:\\n1.

In the practical knowledge section, we will be examining the current state of film production in Vietnam (from the beginning of the 21st century until the present day) by analyzing several popular production models: state funded films, films partially subsidized and commissioned by the government, privately investments, international co-productions, foreign films shooting and hiring crews in Vietnam and independent films seeking finance from domestic and international funds. This section also provides in-depth analysis and comparison regarding different systems of public policy directed towards the cinema industry in Vietnam and other countries such as Korea, China, France and America, apparent in their regulations, development strategies and various situations of censorship. Students will be able to grasp an understanding of how a country\'s public policy impacts the development of its cinema. \\n\\nThe screenwriting exercises, which take up to 75% of the class, will guide students through the process of coming up with ideas suitable to be developed in the context of aforementioned models of production as well as their capacities. Students will be trained to present these ideas in a professional format of a comprehensive look-book that is ready to pitch to potential production companies or investors. \\n\\nDepending on their progress, students are encouraged to develop ideas that challenge the audience\'s usual watching habits, the industry\'s current ability to produce as well as stereotypes about Vietnamese films and censorship in order for them to optimize their imagination and creativity. We hope the students can start contemplating on their own path to materialize the ideas that are \'impossible\' in the current context yet possible in the near future. \\n\\nThere will be two (tentative) guest speakers, Mrs. Dinh Thi Thanh Huong, Vice President of Galaxy Media & Entertainment and Director Charlie Nguyen, who will discuss with students on related topics.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Students will be able to  \\nRECOGNIZE that historical and cultural heritage, as well as regional and global contexts, are all essential to understanding Vietnam;  \\nLISTEN, SPEAK, READ, and WRITE languages essential for understanding Vietnam, including but not limited to: classical/vernacular Chinese, N\xf4m script, and French at CEFR Level A2 or equivalent; \\nPERFORM close-readings and critical interpretations of texts and other media authored by local and international scholars, writers, and cultural producers;  \\nCOMMUNICATE and COLLABORATE effectively in intercultural environments;  \\nFORMULATE and CONDUCT substantial independent research projects;  \\nAPPLY interdisciplinary skills and methods to address contemporary issues and become active citizens in Vietnamese society. \\n---\\nSyllabus\\nSECTION 1 \\nSession 1: Overview of film production in Vietnam from the beginning of 21st century to the present day (Lesson 1): The rapid change of the global film market perceived through the tendency of the audience, the way movies are produced and consumed, the dominance of major cinemas and their impacts on Vietnamese cinema \\n+ What has Vietnamese cinema done to survive in this fiercely competitive and rapidly changing landscape? \\nThe government\'s unsuccessful attempts to regain the dominance through state-funded productions: why did state-funded movies fail and why has this string of failures persisted to this day with no resolution?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research field that studies how to realize the intelligent human behaviors on a computer. The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In this course, student will learn the foundational principles and practice implementing some of these applications including representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence. Accordingly, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.\\n ---\\nLearning Objectives\\nThe main purpose of this course is to provide the most fundamental knowledge to the students so that they can understand what the AI is. Students who become interested in AI may go on to the graduate school for further study. Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to:\\nAbility to apply knowledge of AI techniques and synthesize solutions to the discipline and ability to develop a range of typical applications using artificial intelligence methods.\\nAbility to represent knowledge corresponding to practical problems, design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs by properly using classical search algorithms, including breadth-first, depth-first, A*, and heuristic search.\\nAbility to produce intelligent applications of machine learning with statistical learning methods (Na\xefve Bayes), supervised and unsupervised learning models: decision tree, neural networks, single-layer (perceptron) and multilayer networks\\n---\\nTextbook and References\\nArtificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents by Poole and Mackworth.

We first discuss the history of ideas in anthropological theory surrounding ideas of power and social change: early functionalist approaches presumed static traditions, whereas Marxist, feminist and postcolonial intellectual movements invited anthropologists to theorize structure and agency, power and contradiction, dialectics and change. Common-sense notions of \u201csocial movement\u201d still pose a conceptual challenge to anthropology and ethnography as a method: What distinguishes a social movement from social change broadly put? An anthropological approach to politics means that the modern western delimitation of the \u201cpolitical\u201d must itself be viewed as a historical development, and one with gendered, classed and racialized dimensions. How do we locate a social movement ethnographically? What does ethnography as method teach us about social movements that we might not otherwise see? How do we proceed ethically, attending to questions of positionality, subjectivity, objectivity?  \\nThese conceptual discussions are presented in relation to ethnographic studies in Latin America, East Asia, North America and Eastern Europe, wherein students are also introduced to general disciplinary debates such as the challenges of multisited ethnography, cultural relativism, conceptualizing relations between the \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d, digital ethnography, fieldwork methods and ethics, and practices of public anthropology, including writing to and for participants in social movements. The case studies are explored to emphasize the particular benefit of approaching \u201csocial movements\u201d with an anthropological lens onto everyday life; in the process, social theoretical concepts such as Marxism, anarchism, feminism and intersectionality are themselves productively decentered as cultural and historical objects.\\n---\\nLearning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:\\nFrame research and questions within the context of the field\u2019s historic foundations  \\nApply and explain texts and concepts in social science theory. \\nAnalyze social science theory related to \'social movements\' as a history of ideas\\nUnderstand the disciplinary methodology of ethnography in relation to the topic.\\n---\\nTentative Syllabus\\nJune 14\\nIntroduction to Class\\nMODULE I : Social Movements in Theory\\nJune 21\\nPART I: Social Movements in Anthropological Perspective: What is Politics?  \\nNelson, Lise. 2003. \\"Decentering the Movement: Collective Action, Place, and the \'Sedimentation\' of Radical Political Discourses.\\" Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 21:559-581.\\nLagalisse, Erica. 2013. \\"Gossip as Direct Action.\\" In Contesting Publics: Feminism, Activism, Ethnography, edited by Sally and Lynne Phillips Cole.
